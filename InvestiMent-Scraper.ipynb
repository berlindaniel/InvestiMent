The streaming wars continue to heat up and Roku (NASDAQ:) is the latest company to fall victim. Last Friday, the company’s shares fell below $100 — which is quite a large drop from its 52-week high of $176.55.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n \\n last week alone, making it the company’s worst week since it went public two years earlier. The stock fell after Pivotal Research turned bearish on the stock and gave it a “sell” rating.\\xa0\\nAnd according to a Piper Jaffray analyst, the stock may not have hit its bottom yet. Analyst Craig Johnson predicted Roku stock could fall by another 30% in the coming months.\\xa0\\nThe Roku stock drop has been a surprise to many analysts, because the company seems to have made all the right moves over the past year. Even after the recent price drop, the stock is still up 252% year-to-date.\\nThen Apple (NASDAQ:) announced its streaming service would be free for any customers that purchase a Macbook, iPhone or Apple TV. The streaming service is ordinarily priced at $4.99 per month.\\nInvestors weren’t pleased to learn that Apple would be undercutting Roku on price. Immediately following Apple’s announcement, Roku stock suffered its steepest price decline since March.\\xa0\\nIn my opinion, investors overreacted to the news and Roku’s fundamentals are just as strong as they were before Apple’s announcement. Here are three reasons the stock drop isn’t such a bad thing.\\nShares of Roku could drop further in the coming weeks or months, but they will likely rebound thanks to the company’s strong fundamentals. So instead of worrying about the ROKU stock price drop, look at it as a good buying opportunity.\\nAs of this writing, Jamie Johnson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

HMC announced its fiscal 2019 performance Sept. 27. The $40.9 billion endowment gained 6.5% in the fiscal year ended June 30, down  from 2018.\\xa0\\nAlthough HMC is in the middle of an overhaul of its investment portfolio — N.P. Narvekar was  to head up the university’s investment management team — it has made big strides in the last 33 months repositioning the endowment’s assets for long-term success.\\nHistorically, HMC has generated an annualized total return of  since its founding 45 years ago, which is an excellent long-term track record. The fact is, every successful investor goes through a losing streak or a period of underperformance. Harvard is no different.\\xa0\\nOnce Narvekar completes his portfolio overhaul, investors can expect the endowment to be at the top of the performance charts once more.\\xa0In the meantime, here are  owned by Harvard Management Company.\\xa0\\n\\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:GOOG) is the largest of the 17 holdings reported by HMC at the end of June with 112,346 shares of the company’s Class A shares. The market value of those shares ($121.6 million) accounted for 30.0% of the  in assets listed by HMC.\\nIt’s important to remember that the $121 million investment is a small part of the endowment fund’s total portfolio. In 2018, for example, public equities accounted for 31% of the entire endowment. Yet, because HMC has invested most of those funds through outside investment managers, very few of its overall investments appear in SEC filings.\\xa0\\nNonetheless, the parent of Google is HMC’s largest holding in its 13-F. In May, I listed “.” Of those reasons, I would say that my three favorite reasons in no particular order would be healthy revenue growth, Google Cloud, and its massive free cash flow.\\xa0\\nDespite generating 33% of the online global ad revenue, it is still growing them at more than 30% a quarter. It is this kind of healthy revenue growth that’s led to  in trailing 12-month free cash flow, allowing it to reinvest in growth businesses such as Google Cloud.\\xa0When it comes to generating profits and cash flow, there aren’t many stocks better at it than Alphabet.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nThe maker of iPhones is HMC’s second-largest holding at 506,683 shares worth $100.3 million. Since HMC’s second-quarter filing at the end of June, Apple (NASDAQ:) stock has generated a 13.8% return for the endowment over the past three months. When its next 13-F comes out in November, its AAPL holdings ought to be closer to $114 million.\\xa0\\nHMC first acquired  of Apple stock in the first quarter of 2018. It has since scaled that back to less than a third of its original holdings. Apple stock has gained 33% in the 21 months between the end of 2017 and the end of September, an annualized return of almost 19%, not including dividends.\\xa0\\nInvestorPlace contributor Wayne Duggan recently highlighted the fact that  for Apple’s iPhone 11 has been very positive with pre-order activity in China, almost double what it was a year ago.\\xa0\\nWith more than 65 million iPhone users in China in need of an upgrade according to analysts, Apple skeptics might want to tone done their rhetoric a little. The demise of the iPhone’s been greatly exaggerated.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nFor HMC’s third-largest position, we go from two tech companies to a travel company that uses technology to bring travel providers together with consumers and businesses.\\xa0\\nAt a market cap of almost $84 billion, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:), once known as Priceline because of its name-your-price feature for booking air travel, is now focusing more of its energy on the hotel and apartment rental business.\\xa0\\nIn February, Skift, an online magazine dedicated to the business of travel, detailed how Booking Holdings was in a dead heat with Airbnb in the world of alternative accommodations.\\xa0\\n“Booking also revealed that it generated $2.8 billion in alternative accommodations revenue in 2018, accounting for 20 percent of the company’s overall revenue and that the business is ‘nicely profitable,’  Dennis Schaal. It’s one of the many reasons I recently named BKNG one of the seven stocks to buy benefiting from millennial money.\\xa0\\n“Just because they [Millennials] want to travel, doesn’t mean they want to do it in the same manner as their parents,”  Sept. 12.\\xa0 “Therefore, for travel companies to be successful, they’ve got to provide a combination of unique experiences, budget prices, and excellent customer service; three things that aren’t easy to deliver.”\\nAs long as millennials continue to enjoy traveling, I’d expect HMC to continue to hang on to Booking Holdings.\\n\\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nFacebook (NASDAQ:) is HMC’s fourth-largest holding with 170,081 shares and a June 30 market value of $32.8 million.\\xa0\\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to Harvard before \\xa0so that he could run his social media company on a full-time basis. Now he’s worth $69.0 billion or 50% more than Harvard’s entire endowment.\\xa0How’s that for irony?\\nRecently, Zuckerberg addressed Facebook employees over concerns that 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren would break up the company if elected. Zuckerberg is reported to have  that if Warren tries to break up the company, it would challenge the Senator’s plans in court — and win.\\xa0\\nWarren didn’t back down, suggesting that companies like Facebook, which trample on people’s privacy rights, ought to be taken to task.\\xa0\\nEarlier this year, I suggested that , but it’s a terrible company. I don’t think anything has changed to alter my opinion.\\xa0\\nHMC clearly owns FB stock because of its position within the online advertising industry and the profits these ads generate and not because  an honorary degree in 2017.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nOf HMC’s eight stocks held, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:) is the fifth-largest holding with 54,006 shares and a June 30 market value of $11.0 million.\\nThe California company specializes in cybersecurity products including firewall protection, endpoint protection, cloud security, and cybersecurity analytics. You would think in today’s world of computer security breaches, a company like Palo Alto would have a top-performing stock.\\xa0\\nUnfortunately, that hasn’t been the case for PANW, which generated a  over the past year, significantly worse than the total return (45.4%) of its application software peers.\\xa0One reason for Palo Alto’s lack of performance could be the competitive threats from newer entrants in the cybersecurity marketplace.\\xa0\\n“So I think the competition is Zscaler,” Palo Alto Chief Technology Officer Nir Zuk said in its . “However, I strongly believe that the right architecture and the right products at the end of the day win.”\\nThe fact that HMC holds Palo Alto and not Zscaler suggests it believes PANW will be the ultimate winner.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nOf HMC’s 17 holdings from its 13-F, nine are ETFs, with the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:) its largest holding with 72,147 shares and a June 30 market value of $21.3 million.\\xa0\\nWhat’s interesting about HMC holding IVV is that it’s doing precisely what Warren Buffett suggests most individual investors ought to do: buy the stocks of America’s largest companies and never stop buying.\\n“The trick is not to pick the right company, the trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low cost way,” Buffett  in May 2017.\\xa0\\nWell, IVV has a management expense ratio of just 0.04%. Even a big investment manager like HMC can’t do better than four basis points for 500 of America’s largest companies.\\nIn fact, iShares uses IVV as  to create a core portfolio of stocks and bonds for conservative, moderate, and aggressive investors. Under a really aggressive portfolio with 100% stocks and no bonds, IVV would account for 32% of the portfolio. If you can’t beat them, join them.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nThe Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:) is an excellent complement to the IVV because it invests in a group of large-, mid-, and small-cap companies in developed countries such as Canada, while excluding the U.S.\\xa0\\nIt tracks the performance of the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index holding  with 53% of the companies from Europe, another 37% from the Pacific region, and Canada and several other countries accounting for the rest.\\xa0\\nThe ETF’s top 10 holdings account for 10.5% of the fund’s $70.4 billion in total net assets. The median market cap of its 3,959 holdings is $27.5 billion, making VEA very much a large-cap ETF dressed up as an all-cap fund.\\xa0HMC owns 329,167 shares of VEA, the second-largest holding of its nine ETFs, and has a market value of $13.7 million.\\xa0\\nVEA and IVV have 3-year total returns of 6.3% and 13.4%, respectively, providing investors of all types with a good one-two punch.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

That\\'s about 9 million more users than the research firm predicted last year.\\nAmazon is also making progress toward catching up with Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), the market leader in the United States. Fire TV users are expected to grow at an 8.1% rate over the next four years, faster than Roku\\'s 6.7% expected growth rate. Importantly, the growth of both already-popular platforms is outpacing the rest of the industry.\\nThat\\'s particularly notable as streaming becomes a primary source for video entertainment in more and more households in the United States. Roku and Amazon are poised to benefit while others struggle to keep up.\\nImage source: Roku.\\nAmazon and Roku account for nearly 70% of installed streaming devices in the United States, according to Parks Associates. Roku still owns a healthy lead over Amazon in terms of installment base and users in the U.S., one eMarketer says will persist.\\nAs their combined growth continues to outpace that of the rest of the industry, the two are creating a duopoly in streaming similar to the duopoly that Alphabet\\'s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) have in digital advertising. Even in that industry, though, the two leaders combine for just about 60% of the market. Amazon and Roku\\'s combined dominance has the potential to be much stronger.\\nA duopoly has big implications for both media companies and advertisers as more money flows into streaming.\\nMedia companies that want to offer a streaming service must work with Amazon and Roku in order to succeed. That gives both companies significant leverage in negotiating things like revenue shares for subscribers or advertising inventory shares.\\nAmazon has notably flexed its muscle over the last year. It started requiring all ad-supported services to provide it with 30% of their ad inventories last fall. Roku takes the same cut. Meanwhile, it managed to settle a dispute with Google to bring YouTube and YouTube TV to the Fire TV platform despite an intense rivalry between the two companies.\\nTheir strength is notable as part of the upcoming launch of Apple\\'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) streaming service Apple TV+. One of the big goals of Apple\\'s new service is to bring consumers into its Apple TV Channels ecosystem, where it can sell additional subscriptions. But Apple couldn\\'t offer a streaming service without supporting the most popular connected TV platforms, even if it means ceding control and sacrificing some of the strategic benefits.\\nFor smaller companies, it could mean having to pay more to play. Both Roku and Amazon have their own content that they might prefer to promote to their users over another company\\'s content. Placement in the Roku Channel, for example, might come with additional costs for those media companies compared to a user streaming the same content in a stand-alone channel.\\nImage source: Amazon.\\nAdvertisers looking to shift ad budgets from traditional television to streaming video don\\'t have too many options outside of Amazon and Roku for targeting customers at scale on TVs. There are a few -- like YouTube and Disney\\'s\\xa0Hulu -- but an increasingly large share of premium digital video ad inventory on televisions will fall into the hands of Roku and Amazon. That\\'s even more the case as their respective first-party ad-supported services, The Roku Channel and IMDb TV, increase in popularity.\\nThat\\'s not necessarily bad for advertisers. Fewer ad platforms mean lower personnel needs and a simpler ad-buying strategy. Meanwhile, the targeting capabilities of Amazon are incomparable considering the data it collects on consumer\\'s shopping habits. Roku\\'s targeting isn\\'t too shabby either, as it focuses on helping marketers target audiences they can\\'t reach elsewhere.\\nBut those efficiencies have downsides for advertisers as well. Amazon and Roku will be able to command premiums for their ad pricing compared to smaller competitors due to their broader reach and better targeting capabilities. This has played out with Google and Facebook commanding premiums compared to their competitors.\\xa0\\nWhile Amazon and Roku will still have to produce positive ROIs, they\\'ll be able to create much more efficient markets for ad spending than smaller competitors with less inventory and demand. Marketers hoping to capitalize on the digital video ad market producing lower costs and higher returns for the same advertisements might not have very many opportunities with Roku and Amazon.\\nOf course, that\\'s great for Roku and Amazon, which will benefit from higher ad revenue. Higher average ad prices may also contribute to further control over media companies, especially those relying on ad-supported streaming. Roku or Amazon could negotiate for a higher percentage of revenue if their ad platform is the contributing factor to increased ad prices.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the continued dedication of media companies to releasing services and supporting the Roku and Fire TV platforms means consumers will continue to flock to the platforms, creating a virtuous cycle.\\xa0\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than RokuWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The streaming wars continue to heat up and Roku (NASDAQ:) is the latest company to fall victim. Last Friday, the company’s shares fell below $100 — which is quite a large drop from its 52-week high of $176.55.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n \\n last week alone, making it the company’s worst week since it went public two years earlier. The stock fell after Pivotal Research turned bearish on the stock and gave it a “sell” rating.\\xa0\\nAnd according to a Piper Jaffray analyst, the stock may not have hit its bottom yet. Analyst Craig Johnson predicted Roku stock could fall by another 30% in the coming months.\\xa0\\nThe Roku stock drop has been a surprise to many analysts, because the company seems to have made all the right moves over the past year. Even after the recent price drop, the stock is still up 252% year-to-date.\\nThen Apple (NASDAQ:) announced its streaming service would be free for any customers that purchase a Macbook, iPhone or Apple TV. The streaming service is ordinarily priced at $4.99 per month.\\nInvestors weren’t pleased to learn that Apple would be undercutting Roku on price. Immediately following Apple’s announcement, Roku stock suffered its steepest price decline since March.\\xa0\\nIn my opinion, investors overreacted to the news and Roku’s fundamentals are just as strong as they were before Apple’s announcement. Here are three reasons the stock drop isn’t such a bad thing.\\nShares of Roku could drop further in the coming weeks or months, but they will likely rebound thanks to the company’s strong fundamentals. So instead of worrying about the ROKU stock price drop, look at it as a good buying opportunity.\\nAs of this writing, Jamie Johnson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

Between its critical third-quarter earnings report in two weeks and the launch of new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Disney (NYSE: DIS) streaming video services next month, there are a lot of things that can go wrong for the premium streaming leader. One Wall Street pro seems to think the fallout could be severe unless Netflix tweaks its prices.\\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin feels that Netflix could shed as many as 10 million of its 60.1 million U.S. subscribers at its current monthly rates. With a year of Apple+ being bundled into new-device purchases at no additional cost, and Disney recently selling three-year prepaid plans to Disney+ for roughly $4 a month, it\\'s going to be difficult to stand out\\xa0with its standard plan\\'s monthly pricing of $12.99. Netflix seems out of touch, especially if the economy sours and consumers\\xa0brace for a recession. This could be a lose-lose situation for Netflix, but it pays not to underestimate what CEO Reed Hastings can do.\\nImage source: Netflix.\\nThe pricing war is real, and it\\'s easy to see why Netflix can feel the pinch next month with the Nov. 1 launch of Apple+ and Disney+ following less than two weeks later. Netflix at $12.99 a month has been a compelling value proposition for folks paying several times that amount to their cable and satellite television providers, but will those same deal seekers now flock to cheaper new services launching with top-shelf content?\\xa0\\nNetflix can respond with a price cut, but that would likely trigger an even bigger collapse in the stock than just the potential slow drain of high-paying members. There doesn\\'t seem a way out for Netflix, but there is a third option -- and a fourth, if you care to get creative.\\xa0\\nThe third option would be for Netflix to play the same game that Disney and Apple are playing. Offering a multiyear discount now -- before the launch of Apple+ and Disney+ muddle the marketplace -- would help lock in long-term Netflix customers, and it\\'s about the only case where the investing community would applaud what is effectively a price cut. With Netflix prices unlikely to rise in the near term given the suddenly cutthroat nature of this niche, discounted multiyear deals are not likely to cause huge concern among investors.\\xa0\\nAnother option would be to roll out a more affordable ad-supported version. Netflix has always resisted the urge to jam up its user experience with marketing missives, but it could be one way for it to offer a lower-priced plan without disrupting its premium positioning. As the undisputed top dog with more than a decade of streaming data, it\\'s fair to say that advertisers would love to get in on anything that Netflix may offer on that front. Needham\\'s Martin suggests that Netflix consider a $6 a month ad-saddled streaming plan.\\nNetflix ultimately has to do something. If can\\'t follow up its jarring\\xa0second-quarter subscriber miss\\xa0with another clunker later this month and no new ideas in hand. Locking in members with discounted multiyear plans, a cheaper ad-supported plan, or even a long overdue push into digital rentals\\xa0will be the only ways it can save its stock if the news will be unpleasant when it reports after the market close on Oct. 16.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With the impending launches of new streaming services from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Disney (NYSE: DIS), AT&T\\'s (NYSE: T) WarnerMedia, and Comcast\\'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal, Needham analyst Laura Martin believes Netflix\\'s domestic subscriber count could fall by 5 million to 10 million users in 2020.\\nThat is, unless the streaming leader offers a cheaper service. Apple TV+ will cost just $4.99 a month at launch and Disney+ will cost just $6.99. Netflix\\'s service starts at $8.99 per month, and its most popular plan costs $12.99. Martin suggests it could compete with a $6 per month ad-supported service -- the same pricing as Disney\\'s Hulu.\\nLower pricing from new competitors shouldn\\'t have nearly as big an impact on Netflix as Martin suggests. Here\\'s why.\\nImage source: Netflix\\nThe idea that current subscribers will substitute Disney+ or Apple TV+ for Netflix is far-fetched. It has an unparalleled catalog of content. While Disney and Apple will offer access to some top-tier content as well, it\\'s hard to imagine millions of subscribers dropping everything Netflix offers to save a few bucks each month.\\nJust the opposite: Consumers are more likely to justify holding on to their subscription because Disney+ and Apple TV+ are so inexpensive. They\\'re more likely to find room in their budgets elsewhere instead of dropping Netflix.\\nOne such case of shifting budgets is cord-cutting. An increase in affordable streaming options may accelerate the cord-cutting trend, which would actually benefit the company. The streaming leader is seen as the centerpiece to most cord-cutting strategies.\\nIts brand strength gives it more pricing power than competitors. Disney and Apple certainly have strong brands themselves, but not necessarily in streaming video to the home. When you think of Netflix, you only think of one thing. When you think of Disney, you might think of comic book films, animated classics, theme parks, or any number of other things in Disney\\'s business. When you think of Apple, you might think of the tech giant\\'s devices, but not streaming video.\\nA more comparable brand is HBO, which charges $15 per month, partly because it\\'s built a brand strong enough to support that price.\\nNetflix\\'s brand is built on its original series and films. And with a rapidly growing content budget, that brand will only get stronger over time, attracting consumers.\\nNetflix has struck several partnerships over the last few years, which are a key part of its continued subscriber growth. This is where its brand strength is crucial. Businesses will only partner with Netflix to distribute its service if its brand is strong enough to bring more customers through the door.\\nIt already has a partnership with T-Mobile, which offers a heavily subsidized Netflix subscription to customers on unlimited plans with two or more lines. T-Mobile may be getting a lot bigger in the near future if its merger with Sprint\\xa0closes.\\nMeanwhile, Netflix has a partnership with Comcast to support the service on its X-1 set-top box platform and to distribute Netflix as part of a bundle of networks. It may partner with other distributors in the same way.\\nSuch partnerships increase switching costs for customers of both Netflix and the partner. That\\'s another reason Netflix\\'s partners like them. As such, the subscribers it attracts through partnerships are less likely to switch services and have a higher lifetime value.\\nCEO Reed Hastings isn\\'t afraid of the competition. He believes as long as Netflix remains focused on what it does well -- building a strong brand and a portfolio of bingeable content -- it should survive the competition.\\nAs mentioned, it doesn\\'t have to lose in order for the competition to succeed. Nobody believes that more than Hastings, who subscribes to HBO and says he\\'ll subscribe to Disney+ when it is launched. And that\\'s not just to keep tabs on the competition -- it\\'s because there have never been more quality options for consumers. Still, Netflix will sit at the top of the list for most.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That\\'s about 9 million more users than the research firm predicted last year.\\nAmazon is also making progress toward catching up with Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), the market leader in the United States. Fire TV users are expected to grow at an 8.1% rate over the next four years, faster than Roku\\'s 6.7% expected growth rate. Importantly, the growth of both already-popular platforms is outpacing the rest of the industry.\\nThat\\'s particularly notable as streaming becomes a primary source for video entertainment in more and more households in the United States. Roku and Amazon are poised to benefit while others struggle to keep up.\\nImage source: Roku.\\nAmazon and Roku account for nearly 70% of installed streaming devices in the United States, according to Parks Associates. Roku still owns a healthy lead over Amazon in terms of installment base and users in the U.S., one eMarketer says will persist.\\nAs their combined growth continues to outpace that of the rest of the industry, the two are creating a duopoly in streaming similar to the duopoly that Alphabet\\'s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) have in digital advertising. Even in that industry, though, the two leaders combine for just about 60% of the market. Amazon and Roku\\'s combined dominance has the potential to be much stronger.\\nA duopoly has big implications for both media companies and advertisers as more money flows into streaming.\\nMedia companies that want to offer a streaming service must work with Amazon and Roku in order to succeed. That gives both companies significant leverage in negotiating things like revenue shares for subscribers or advertising inventory shares.\\nAmazon has notably flexed its muscle over the last year. It started requiring all ad-supported services to provide it with 30% of their ad inventories last fall. Roku takes the same cut. Meanwhile, it managed to settle a dispute with Google to bring YouTube and YouTube TV to the Fire TV platform despite an intense rivalry between the two companies.\\nTheir strength is notable as part of the upcoming launch of Apple\\'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) streaming service Apple TV+. One of the big goals of Apple\\'s new service is to bring consumers into its Apple TV Channels ecosystem, where it can sell additional subscriptions. But Apple couldn\\'t offer a streaming service without supporting the most popular connected TV platforms, even if it means ceding control and sacrificing some of the strategic benefits.\\nFor smaller companies, it could mean having to pay more to play. Both Roku and Amazon have their own content that they might prefer to promote to their users over another company\\'s content. Placement in the Roku Channel, for example, might come with additional costs for those media companies compared to a user streaming the same content in a stand-alone channel.\\nImage source: Amazon.\\nAdvertisers looking to shift ad budgets from traditional television to streaming video don\\'t have too many options outside of Amazon and Roku for targeting customers at scale on TVs. There are a few -- like YouTube and Disney\\'s\\xa0Hulu -- but an increasingly large share of premium digital video ad inventory on televisions will fall into the hands of Roku and Amazon. That\\'s even more the case as their respective first-party ad-supported services, The Roku Channel and IMDb TV, increase in popularity.\\nThat\\'s not necessarily bad for advertisers. Fewer ad platforms mean lower personnel needs and a simpler ad-buying strategy. Meanwhile, the targeting capabilities of Amazon are incomparable considering the data it collects on consumer\\'s shopping habits. Roku\\'s targeting isn\\'t too shabby either, as it focuses on helping marketers target audiences they can\\'t reach elsewhere.\\nBut those efficiencies have downsides for advertisers as well. Amazon and Roku will be able to command premiums for their ad pricing compared to smaller competitors due to their broader reach and better targeting capabilities. This has played out with Google and Facebook commanding premiums compared to their competitors.\\xa0\\nWhile Amazon and Roku will still have to produce positive ROIs, they\\'ll be able to create much more efficient markets for ad spending than smaller competitors with less inventory and demand. Marketers hoping to capitalize on the digital video ad market producing lower costs and higher returns for the same advertisements might not have very many opportunities with Roku and Amazon.\\nOf course, that\\'s great for Roku and Amazon, which will benefit from higher ad revenue. Higher average ad prices may also contribute to further control over media companies, especially those relying on ad-supported streaming. Roku or Amazon could negotiate for a higher percentage of revenue if their ad platform is the contributing factor to increased ad prices.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the continued dedication of media companies to releasing services and supporting the Roku and Fire TV platforms means consumers will continue to flock to the platforms, creating a virtuous cycle.\\xa0\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than RokuWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, stocks rebounded from the morning lows, giving investors confidence a bounce may ensue. Let’s look at a few top stock trades.\\xa0\\n\\nShares of Apple (NASDAQ:) failed to breakout over the $226 area, but are holding up well given the overall temperature of the market.\\xa0\\nOn a pullback, I was hoping to see the $215 level. Apple traded down to $215.13 on the day, before ricocheting higher back over $220. That’s just what the doctor ordered!\\nThe $215 level and 50-day moving average are important for the bulls to maintain. Below opens up Apple to further selling pressure and technical damage. \\nFrom here, let’s see if AAPL can maintain above the 20-day moving average. If it can, another test of $226 could be in the cards.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nJPMorgan (NYSE:) broke out to new highs last month, but has been struggling to maintain altitude. Unfortunately, the stock couldn’t hold up over prior resistance near $115, nor the 78.6% retracement and 20-day moving average.\\xa0\\nHowever, after briefly breaking below the 50-day moving average, shares were able to recover. Let’s see how the bank does going forward. Does it bounce and rally up to the 78.6% retracement and 20-day moving average? Or do shares continue lower to the 61.8% near $109? \\nI would love a deeper correction down to the $106 area and 200-day moving average for a longer-term buy.\\xa0\\n\\nSnap (NYSE:) remains as volatile as ever. A September breakout reversed itself, temporarily plunging the stock in just a few days. Then in just eight sessions, shares went from almost making new highs, to falling more than 20% from peak to trough.\\xa0\\nMan, this is a tough one to pin down. However, with Thursday’s reversal off the lows, bulls may consider a long position with a stop-loss either at the day’s low or at the 61.8% retracement, depending on how aggressive they want to be.\\xa0\\nHolding above $14 is a good sign, and should Snap hurdle prior downtrend resistance (blue line), then a move back to the 78.6% retracement is possible.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOn Wednesday,  the impressive relative strength in Lennar (NYSE:). But another stock showing relative strength is Proofpoint (NASDAQ:).\\xa0\\n because not only are these stocks holding up the best in a tough tape, but they are often the ones that do the best when the overall market comes back to life.\\xa0\\nNotice how this one has been trading sideways between $130 resistance and $122/the 50-day moving average. A break over this range can send PFPT to the recent highs at $133, while a rally above can gain momentum as a possible breakout.\\xa0\\n\\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:) bounced right where InvestorPlace readers where looking for and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:) posted a strong bounce on Thursday from an unsurprising location.\\xa0\\nThe stock held uptrend support from August (blue line) and the 78.6% retracement. We flagged this spot on Twitter .\\xa0\\nWhile some reprieve from the selling is welcomed by the bulls, a further decline down to the 200-day moving average and August lows would have been more enticing for a stronger reversal.\\xa0\\nFailure to get there now only leaves it as a possibility for a later date. It doesn’t mean we have to test this level, but it would have been healthier price action in my view.\\xa0\\nFrom here, let’s see if the SPY can reclaim the 50-day moving average and prior resistance from August. If it can’t, another test of uptrend support is in the cards. Over the 50-day puts the Fed-day low in the cards.\\xa0\\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

We\\'re about one month away from the launch of Apple\\'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Disney\\'s (NYSE: DIS) streaming video services. And while they are priced to move at $4.99 to $6.99 per month, respectively, that extra entertainment money is going to come from somewhere.\\nThe problem will compound when consumers are given even more choices with the introductions of HBO Max from AT&T\\'s (NYSE: T) WarnerMedia and Peacock from Comcast\\'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal early next year. Not only will there be two more premium options for consumers to choose, but those services are also expected to be more expensive than Apple TV+ or Disney+.\\nThat said, management from nearly every company with a stake in the game is confident that its service will thrive. And with good reason. Consumers are showing an increasing willingness to subscribe to multiple video services, and early demand has surpassed expectations. But people don\\'t have an unlimited budget, in terms of time or money, so where will that consumer spending come from?\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nIf someone can stream more of the content they love, the first thing they\\'ll stop doing is paying for individual downloads. The music industry has seen a huge impact on digital downloads now that practically every song is available as part of an all-you-can-listen buffet. Streaming music accounted for 80% of the industry\\'s revenue in the U.S. during the first half of 2019. Digital download revenue fell from $2.3 billion in 2013 to $1 billion last year.\\nThe streaming video industry isn\\'t quite the same as streaming music. But as more content becomes available on streaming platforms, the less content people will take from digital downloads.\\nHere\\'s the rub. Digital download and rental sales have already fallen off the cliff. Self-reported rental and download spend in the U.S. has been cut in half since 2012, according to Parks Associates. The average consumer claims to spend only a couple of bucks a month on downloads.\\nSo while companies with digital video stores like Apple or Amazon.com\\xa0could see a further decline in downloads, there\\'s not much farther to fall.\\nThere are two other areas of home video that could see a significant impact from the plethora of streaming video options available: DVD and Blu-ray sales and pay-TV subscriptions.\\nBelieve it or not, people still buy DVDs and Blu-rays. Disney generates billions from physical sales of its catalog every year. But when every Disney movie becomes available for streaming, the appeal of the shelf full of boxes for baby to pick out becomes less appealing. That represents a huge opportunity for Disney to attract a large group of consumers to Disney+, but it comes at the cost of cannibalization.\\nNot every media company has home video sales as strong as Disney\\'s, but giving customers another way to watch their favorite films or series without needing to buy physical media will surely cut into those sales. That also means companies like Disney, with greater home entertainment sales, have a greater risk as more entertainment transitions to streaming.\\nThe bigger entertainment budget for most households, however, still goes toward a pay-TV subscription. The average pay-TV household spends over $100 per month on its subscription. Cutting or shaving the cord will open a considerable budget for streaming video.\\nThe losers here are traditional cable providers such as Comcast and AT&T. Disney may be a winner with its relatively low-cost Hulu + Live TV subscription, but investors should expect cord-cutting to keep declining considerably as more premium streaming options come to market. Comcast is reportedly going to offer the Peacock service free with ads to its cable subscribers as an effort to prevent cord-cutting, but it\\'ll also offer the service ad-free for a price.\\nOne challenge both consumers and analysts have with evaluating the streaming video industry is mental accounting. The idea that if consumers spend a certain amount on home entertainment per month they\\'ll only ever spend that amount per month is a fallacy. Spending will go up and down depending on a number of factors. Importantly, none of those factors are \"how much did I spend on streaming video last month?\"\\nIn other words,\\xa0Netflix\\xa0doesn\\'t have to lose for Disney+ to win. And consumers don\\'t have to cut the cord just because they want HBO Max.\\nThe average household spends more on eating out and drinking than on entertainment, both in-home and out-of-home. It spends nearly three times as much on transportation. Maybe one fewer trip to a restaurant per month will open the budget for spending on a few new streaming services.\\nWhile digital downloads and pay-TV will continue to suffer as more streaming services come to market and streaming gains popularity, most consumers won\\'t drastically change their behavior around other sources of entertainment. They might, however, shift their whole budget around to prioritize the things they want most. So whichever services offer a compelling content catalog are very likely to succeed despite other well-established and popular competitors in the market.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than Walt DisneyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Find out in MyWallSt\\'s free guide!\\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) is one of the most closely studied and followed stock portfolios on the planet and has thrived under the leadership of founder and stock market guru Warren Buffett.\\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\\nHere at MyWallSt, we have built our investment strategy around the ideology of Buffett himself: buy and hold \\'til we\\'re grey and old! This is the basic tenet of Buffett\\'s strategy: He believes in investing in companies with long-term value rather than a \"flash in the pan.\" We take a look at arguably the five best additions to the Buffett portfolio.\\nBerkshire Hathaway currently owns roughly 5% of the second-richest company on Earth, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). It also happens to be Berkshire\\'s top holding by quite a large margin, coming in at close to a $50 billion market value. Buffett first began buying up shares in Steve Jobs\\' brainchild in 2016 and has bought more shares every quarter since, with gains coming in at around 25% since its first purchase. Despite Apple\\'s declining hardware sales, Buffett firmly believes in the company\\'s \"stickiness,\" or the ability to remain relevant in everyday consumer life for years to come.\\nMuch of Berkshire\\'s enormous 9.3% stake in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) came about following the Great Recession of 2008. The investment mogul invested $5 billion into the struggling bank, purchasing the shares at a much-reduced price of $7.14 per share, well below the trading price at the time of $26.99 per share. With the bank growing back to its pre-recession heights, Buffett has seen the market value of his position in BofA grow to $26.7 billion, making it an extremely successful investment.\\nIt\\'s safe to say that Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) hasn\\'t been short of scandals in recent years, which has contributed to it being one of the worst-performing banks in the sector. However, through all of this, Warren Buffett has publicly backed his investment and its managers. Wells Fargo is one of Buffett\\'s oldest banking investments, which he bought in 1989 worth $3 per share. With CEO Tim Sloan resigning earlier this year, and its stock price seemingly beginning to become steady after a fluctuating year, the company looks to be on the path to recovery. Despite all this, it\\'s still one of Buffett\\'s top stocks, and he has actually had to sell shares to meet regulatory demands of remaining below 10% ownership, with the market value of his position coming in at close to $20 billion.\\nAnother golden oldie for Warren Buffet -- he purchased his first Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) stock back in 1988 at a time of struggle\\xa0-- that appears to still hold his seal of approval despite the changing landscape and growing health-consciousness of the average consumer. Buffett originally paid $1.3 billion for shares of the company, which translates to a current market value of roughly $18 billion, an increase of almost 1,300%. The investment pays Berkshire a massive $650 million per year and has seen increases in annual dividends almost annually for the past 50 years. It pays to own 9.5% of the world\\'s most recognizable beverage maker. Fun fact: Buffett is actually a massive fan of the drink itself, and claims to drink several cans a day.\\nIn a surprising move, Berkshire Hathaway recently bought a stake in e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). One of Buffett\\'s two lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, started a position in the first quarter of 2019, and then added shares in the second. Though not a typical Buffett stock, considering its high price and price-to-earnings ratio, the purchase was still a wise move, as Amazon does fit the Buffett model of compounding growth with a formidable moat. The dominant leader in e-commerce over the past 25 years, Amazon has grown into a massive empire including hardware, music, streaming, and more. Not only does its core delivery service control 50% of U.S. market share, but its subsidiaries such as Amazon Web Services are also dominating in their respective fields. It may be too early to call it a great Buffett investment, but it has all the signs of potentially being his greatest yet.\\nImage source: MyWallSt.\\nOne of these pot stocks is already\\xa0+100% this year.

Apple stock has been a buy for decades and a few weak ISM reports are not going to change this fact. There still is much more upside from here.\\nSource: thanat sasipatanapa / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nCritics call it an iPhone company and they point out that they are losing steam in that department. While this fact is correct, AAPL is in the process of shifting sales focus to services, thereby reducing their dependency on upgrade cycles of phones.\\nFurthermore, they are putting more effort into wearables, which will undoubtedly become the new way we communicate. They are long overdue because most of us only really need a smaller wearable smart device like an Apple Watch. There AAPL has a strong start as they have millions sold already, and therein lies another set of upgrade cycles. The watches have a cheaper price point so more people will upgrade them more often and it’s an easier sell.\\nYou’d be wrong to label me a perma-bull on AAPL stock as I can assure you that I trade it without any emotions. I personally do not like AAPL products and I definitely don’t think highly of Tim Cook. He is at best a marginal COO. AAPL would have done as well off even without a CEO since Steve Jobs untimely death.\\nI also think that Cook added over $100 billion in debt with almost nothing to show for other than financial engineering. I bet that Jeff Bezos would have found better uses for this cash that would have added a few verticals for new income streams — think AWS for Amazon (NASDAQ:).\\nBack to today’s point, Apple stock is still a safe bet for as long as the market-wide thesis is bullish. We have global central banks still 100% committed to inflating our economies. Add to it that politicians will do what they can to spruce up the economy in the U.S., and you get a bullish thesis that will not die so easily. I can never discount a black swan event, but shorting this momentum is easier said than done.\\nUnder this assumption I can go long AAPL stock now into its next earnings report. If my intentions are for the long term then I would only manage my risk after the binary earnings event later this month. Otherwise, I would place proper stops that match my time frames.\\nFor example, on the daily chart, $215.30 and $211.50 are spots where I expect support. There is also stronger support close to $202 per share. It is important to note that there are two small 120 minute gaps to $209.7 and $206 per share which could come into play if markets continue with this sentiment crisis.\\nAnother way I can get bullish Apple stock is by selling downside risk into what others fear. This way I won’t even need a rally to profit. For example, I can sell AAPL December $180 put and collect $2 for my efforts. So even if the stock falls 15% from here, I can still retain my maximum gains. Otherwise, I own the shares at a steep discount and won’t suffer losses until below $183 per share. To limit the downside risk I would sell a put spread instead.\\nAs for the earnings outcomes, they are binary. We don’t know what management will deliver or forecast, nor do we know how traders will react to them. Even if they give us the P&L in advance we couldn’t guess if it opens up or down the next day. But often the stock rallies into the earnings, so starting long now may give traders the opportunity to enter and exit before earnings. Those who want to own it for the long term need not worry so much about timing. Take positions in tranches and all will be fine with time. It is a fact that those who owned Apple stock for decades have a ton of profits in hand.\\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of\\xa0.

The tech giant’s shares have also jumped over 5% this week as Wall Street seems pleased with Apple’s latest round of iPhones and its streaming TV plans.\\niPhone Updates\\nApple unveiled its newest iPhones at its now customary pre-holiday shopping season event on Tuesday, led by CEO Tim Cook and other top executives. The firm showed off three new iPhones, under the new 11 branding.\\nThe smartphones feature Apple’s somewhat standard updates, which include better battery life and faster processors. What separates the two new higher-priced smartphones (iPhone 11 Pro & 11 Pro Max: starting at $999) from their less expensive peer (iPhone 11: starting at $699), is a triple-camera system. Apple also dropped the price of last year’s iPhone XR by 20% ($599), with the iPhone 8 starting at $449.\\nConsumers might be more prone to buy the higher-end iPhone 11s because the price points roughly match last year’s new high-end models—after years of rising prices. Perhaps more importantly, the new iPhone 11 base model is actually $50 cheaper than last year’s comparable offering. Clearly, Apple wants to give consumers every reason possible to upgrade to new phones after a year of poor iPhone sales, especially since there is nothing earth-shattering about the new phones.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nApple TV+ & Services\\xa0 \\nWall Street, investors, and Apple fans have waited for more details on Apple’s foray into the streaming TV world for months. They now have all they can hope for until they get to use the streaming service for the first time on November 1—Disney+ debuts on Nov. 12. Anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other qualifying devices will get a year worth of Apple TV+ for free. The service will otherwise cost $4.99 per month, after a seven-day free trial and be available on the Apple TV app.\\nApple’s streaming TV offering is clearly priced to move, as it comes in well below HBO Go’s T $14.99 per month, Netflix’s NFLX $15.99 premium plan, Amazon AMZN Prime’s $12.99—which comes with shipping perks—and Disney+ at $6.99. Aside from trying not to force users into a decision between Apple+ or Netflix, the price-point represents how little content will be available at launch.\\nApple TV+ will feature roughly 10 shows at launch, including a fictional space race-era show called For All Mankind, a show starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell titled The Morning Show, and post-apocalyptic drama See. \\xa0\\nApple will then slowly build up its library of shows, which is set to feature more A-list Hollywood stars both in front of and behind the camera. The iPhone maker is also likely viewing Apple TV+ as a kind of loss-leader for now, since it reportedly spent roughly $15 million an episode to make See.\\nApple is making a long-term play to convert more of its roughly 1 billion hardware users into services customers. This business, which includes its app store, Spotify SPOT challenger Apple Music, a monthly magazine-heavy news service, and an Apple credit card, will also soon feature Apple Arcade. The company’s big push into the video game world will feature access to roughly 100 titles for $4.99 per month and launch on September 19. Apple hopes to grab a piece of the $68.5 billion global mobile game market.\\nWhat Else?\\nThe ongoing U.S. and China trade war spooked some Apple investors early, but Cook has been in constant contact with President Trump and its biggest products have remained untouched. Plus, the last few days have seen both China and the U.S. slightly change their tunes as the two sides prepare to meet once again in a few weeks.\\nApple’s iPhone sales did slip in each of the last three quarters, as did the firm’s Greater China revenue. The company has found it harder to sell its higher-priced smartphones in a market with so many less expensive options available.\\nMeanwhile, iPhone sales slipped on the back of hard to compare periods, which means a 2020 turn around could be in store. In fact, Apple’s sales popped 1% last quarter (Q3 fiscal 2019) after revenue slipped 5.1% in Q2 and 4.5% in Q1.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nQ4 Outlook & Beyond \\nLooking ahead, Apple’s fourth-quarter 2019 revenue is projected to slip 0.56% from the year-ago period to $62.55 billion, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates. This, however, comes against Q4 2018’s 20% top-line expansion. Overall, AAPL’s full-year fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to dip 2.7% to reach $258.28 billion.\\nApple’s first quarter 2020 revenue, which includes the key holiday shopping period, is expected to jump 1.5% to $85.54 billion. Peeking further ahead, AAPL’s fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to climb 3.8% above our 2019 estimate to touch $268.01 billion and top 2018’s figure.\\nAt the bottom end of the income statement, Apple is expected to see its Q4 earnings sink 2.75%, with full-year 2019’s EPS figure set to fall 1.85%. Then, Apple’s Q1 2020 earnings are projected to surge 6.2% over the prior-year quarter, with full-year 2020 expected to come in 11.5% above our 2019 estimates.\\nBottom Line\\nAlong with Apple’s strong 2020 growth outlook, the firm has seen its earnings estimate revision picture trend heavily upward recently, especially for Q4 and fiscal 2019. AAPL is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment that sports an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system.\\nWe can see that Apple has traded at a higher forward price/sales ratio over the last year (4.2 vs. current 3.8). More importantly, Apple is the only of the so-called FAANG stocks that pays a dividend. The company’s current annualized dividend is $3.08 per share, for a 1.38% yield. This compares relatively favorably to the 10-year U.S. Treasury note’s 1.7%.\\nApple also has over $200 billion in cash on hand, which means it is likely to continue its massive buyback program. Therefore, investors should consider AAPL stock as a safe-haven investment, amid our current market uncertainty, with the added potential for big gains.\\nBreakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential\\nThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They’re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases.\\nZacks has just released Century of Biology: 7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance.

With the impending launches of new streaming services from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Disney (NYSE: DIS), AT&T\\'s (NYSE: T) WarnerMedia, and Comcast\\'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal, Needham analyst Laura Martin believes Netflix\\'s domestic subscriber count could fall by 5 million to 10 million users in 2020.\\nThat is, unless the streaming leader offers a cheaper service. Apple TV+ will cost just $4.99 a month at launch and Disney+ will cost just $6.99. Netflix\\'s service starts at $8.99 per month, and its most popular plan costs $12.99. Martin suggests it could compete with a $6 per month ad-supported service -- the same pricing as Disney\\'s Hulu.\\nLower pricing from new competitors shouldn\\'t have nearly as big an impact on Netflix as Martin suggests. Here\\'s why.\\nImage source: Netflix\\nThe idea that current subscribers will substitute Disney+ or Apple TV+ for Netflix is far-fetched. It has an unparalleled catalog of content. While Disney and Apple will offer access to some top-tier content as well, it\\'s hard to imagine millions of subscribers dropping everything Netflix offers to save a few bucks each month.\\nJust the opposite: Consumers are more likely to justify holding on to their subscription because Disney+ and Apple TV+ are so inexpensive. They\\'re more likely to find room in their budgets elsewhere instead of dropping Netflix.\\nOne such case of shifting budgets is cord-cutting. An increase in affordable streaming options may accelerate the cord-cutting trend, which would actually benefit the company. The streaming leader is seen as the centerpiece to most cord-cutting strategies.\\nIts brand strength gives it more pricing power than competitors. Disney and Apple certainly have strong brands themselves, but not necessarily in streaming video to the home. When you think of Netflix, you only think of one thing. When you think of Disney, you might think of comic book films, animated classics, theme parks, or any number of other things in Disney\\'s business. When you think of Apple, you might think of the tech giant\\'s devices, but not streaming video.\\nA more comparable brand is HBO, which charges $15 per month, partly because it\\'s built a brand strong enough to support that price.\\nNetflix\\'s brand is built on its original series and films. And with a rapidly growing content budget, that brand will only get stronger over time, attracting consumers.\\nNetflix has struck several partnerships over the last few years, which are a key part of its continued subscriber growth. This is where its brand strength is crucial. Businesses will only partner with Netflix to distribute its service if its brand is strong enough to bring more customers through the door.\\nIt already has a partnership with T-Mobile, which offers a heavily subsidized Netflix subscription to customers on unlimited plans with two or more lines. T-Mobile may be getting a lot bigger in the near future if its merger with Sprint\\xa0closes.\\nMeanwhile, Netflix has a partnership with Comcast to support the service on its X-1 set-top box platform and to distribute Netflix as part of a bundle of networks. It may partner with other distributors in the same way.\\nSuch partnerships increase switching costs for customers of both Netflix and the partner. That\\'s another reason Netflix\\'s partners like them. As such, the subscribers it attracts through partnerships are less likely to switch services and have a higher lifetime value.\\nCEO Reed Hastings isn\\'t afraid of the competition. He believes as long as Netflix remains focused on what it does well -- building a strong brand and a portfolio of bingeable content -- it should survive the competition.\\nAs mentioned, it doesn\\'t have to lose in order for the competition to succeed. Nobody believes that more than Hastings, who subscribes to HBO and says he\\'ll subscribe to Disney+ when it is launched. And that\\'s not just to keep tabs on the competition -- it\\'s because there have never been more quality options for consumers. Still, Netflix will sit at the top of the list for most.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

On the hardware front, the tech giant released the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max; the Apple Watch Series 5, and a new version of the entry-level iPad. But the tech company also shared more details on two of its upcoming services: Apple Arcade and Apple TV+.\\nWith the iPhone segment accounting for over half of Apple\\'s revenue, it was no surprise that the company\\'s latest versions were the main event for the keynote. But what was interesting is that it wasn\\'t necessarily the flagship iPhone that stole the show on Tuesday. Instead, it was the aggressive pricing of the new iPhone 11 and the subsequent price cut to the current iPhone XR that grabbed the spotlight.\\nHere\\'s a look at the newest iPhones, and why the competitive pricing was a narrative that caught investors\\' attention.\\n\\nThe iPhone 11. Image source: Apple.\\nAs was the case last year, the lineup is made up of three new iPhones: one lower-cost iPhone and two high-end models. To differentiate the two higher-end smartphones from the cheapest new one, Apple gave the more expensive models a \"Pro\" designation this year.\\nHere\\'s how the new lineup breaks down.\\niPhone 11 (starting at $699): In many ways, this is the successor to the iPhone XR that Apple launched last year. Priced lower than the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, it is available in more colors, has a liquid crystal display (LCD) instead of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) version on the higher-end models, and has a display that measures 6.1 inches.\\xa0Setting it apart from the iPhone XR, the new phone has a better camera, improved battery life, and Apple\\'s new A13 Bionic processor.\\niPhone 11 Pro (starting at $999):\\xa0Compared with the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro has a smaller display size of 5.8 inches.\\xa0But it has an OLED display, and an even better camera system than the iPhone 11. It also includes the latest A13 Bionic chip.\\niPhone 11 Pro Max (starting at $1,099): The new flagship iPhone replaces the iPhone XS Max. It is mostly the same as the iPhone 11 Pro but has a 6.5-inch display and five more hours of battery life compared with the iPhone XS Max, giving it the longest battery life of any iPhone.\\xa0\\nWhile the iPhone 11 certainly isn\\'t cheap, it\\'s notably priced $50 lower than the iPhone XR\\'s $749 starting price last year. Perhaps even more surprising, Apple dropped the price of its one-year-old iPhone XR by $150, to $599.\\nThe aggressive pricing could give the iPhone segment a much-needed boost. Its revenue has been declining, and iPhone unit sales, which the company stopped reporting as they started to trend downward, are likely still falling as well.\\nAs Apple transitions to a business model that is focused on monetizing its base of active users with an increasingly robust slate of services, it makes sense to make its iPhones more affordable. This could reinvigorate unit sales growth, which could ultimately bolster the company\\'s installed base of active users, who it can monetize with apps and services in the coming years.\\n\\xa0\\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, there are still plenty of solid tech stocks that are well insulated from those headwinds, and that trade at attractive valuations.\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at three tech stocks that are \"no-brainer\" investment options\\xa0 -- Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Infinera (NASDAQ: INFN).\\nShares of Cisco, the world\\'s top maker of networking routers and switches, have fallen about 10% during the past two months. Most of that drop occurred in mid-August when the company followed up a solid fiscal fourth-quarter report with\\xa0soft guidance for its first quarter.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nCisco\\'s revenue and adjusted earnings rose\\xa07% and 20%, respectively, in fiscal 2019. But for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it expects its revenues to be in the flat to 2% higher range, and for its adjusted EPS to rise 7% to 9% year over year. For the full fiscal year, analysts expect its revenue will rise 2%, and for earnings to climb by 8%.\\nCisco faces tougher year-over-year comparisons in fiscal 2020, as well as decelerating enterprise spending in China, the U.S., and the U.K. due to macroeconomic headwinds like the trade war and Brexit. However, its higher-growth security and applications units (which accounted for 16% of its 2019 revenues) are still generating double-digit percentage sales growth. In fiscal Q4, 70% of its software revenues came from stickier subscriptions, and it only generates a tiny sliver of its sales from China. It also expects its gross and operating margins to hold steady in fiscal Q1, even as its revenue growth slows.\\nCisco still has some irons in the fire. It ended last quarter with $33.4 billion in cash and equivalents, and it recently agreed to buy Acacia Communications (NASDAQ: ACIA) -- one of its suppliers -- in a move that should cut costs and help it upgrade its networking device offerings for data centers. Its forward dividend yield of 2.9% and its forward P/E ratio of 13 should also set a floor under this unloved stock until the near-term headwinds fade.\\nApple today admittedly isn\\'t as innovative as it was under the late Steve Jobs. It\\'s also still too dependent on the iPhone, which generated 48% of its revenues last quarter. But under CEO Tim Cook, it is aggressively expanding its services ecosystem (21% of its sales) with new platforms like Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ -- which could\\xa0generate more revenue per user as its hardware sales decelerate.\\nIt\\'s also making progress in the wearables market with the Apple Watch and AirPods. Cook claimed that\\xa0Apple\\'s wearable sales surged \"well over 50%\" annually last quarter, accelerating from segment growth of\\xa0\"near 50%\" in the second quarter. The HomePod also claimed 5% of\\xa0the U.S. smart speaker market in June, according to research firm CIRP.\\nImage source: Apple.\\nThe initial reception for the new iPhone 11 has also been warm -- even in China, where Apple is struggling with local competition, an economic slowdown, and trade war-related tensions. Cook recently told German newspaper Bild that iPhone 11 sales were off to a \"very strong start.\"\\nAnalysts expect Apple\\'s revenue and earnings will rise 5% and\\xa09%, respectively, next year -- solid growth rates for a stock that trades at 18 times forward earnings. It also pays a\\xa0dividend with a forward yield of 1.8%.\\nMore importantly, Apple ended last quarter with $210.6 billion in cash and equivalents -- which gives it plenty of room for stock buybacks, dividend hikes, acquisitions, and investments in new products. That cash cushion, along with the strength of its brand, makes Apple one of the safest tech stocks to buy for the long term.\\nInfinera isn\\'t as well-known as Cisco or Apple. The optical transmission equipment maker\\xa0mainly sells wave division multiplexing (WDM) systems, which let internet service providers and telecoms increase the capacity of their existing networks without laying down additional fiber -- a cost-effective option for carriers dealing with the bandwidth demand that comes from the rising use of cloud-based services.\\nYet Infinera\\'s stock price plunged from $12 in May 2018 to about $3 in July 2019. There were two key reasons for that drop. First, demand for long-haul WDM systems, from which Infinera generates most of its revenue, dried up as service providers focused on shorter-range WDM solutions like metro and data center interconnect (DCI) systems. Second, its forecasts following its acquisition of Coriant -- a smaller rival which produces shorter-range WDM solutions -- were\\xa0initially too high.\\nHowever, the stock has rebounded by roughly 70% over the past three months as investors realized that its cyclical business was bottoming out and that the concerns about Coriant were likely overblown. Last quarter, Infinera\\'s revenue rose\\xa047% annually, compared to 46% growth in the first quarter. It expects that figure to accelerate again to somewhere in the 60% to 70% range in the third quarter, and for its gross margin to expand sequentially.\\nInfinera remains unprofitable, but it expects its synergies with Coriant to lift its free cash flow and adjusted profits back to positive levels by the fourth quarter. If it achieves those goals, its stock could rally much higher -- since its current market cap is less than this year\\'s sales.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In recent years, tech giants have all been clamoring to design their own silicon in pursuit of various benefits,\\xa0including better optimization of performance and power efficiency, reduced product complexity, and streamlined cost structures.\\nAt this point, Alphabet subsidiary Google, Amazon.com, Facebook, and Tesla are all on the custom chip bandwagon, developing specialized processors designed for specific purposes. It\\'s Microsoft\\'s (NASDAQ: MSFT) turn to hop on.\\nSurface Pro X is powered by a custom SQ1 processor. Image source: Microsoft.\\nAt the company\\'s big hardware event yesterday, the enterprise software specialist announced the new flagship Surface Pro X, a powerful 2-in-1 hybrid device powered by a custom ARM-based SQ1\\xa0chip. Microsoft worked in collaboration with mobile chip behemoth Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to develop the processor, in part to add LTE connectivity to the device while also improving power efficiency.\\nMeet the new Surface ProX. #MicrosoftEvent @panos_panay pic.twitter.com/p4hpg0TZ0L\\n\\n\\n\"This product has three times more performance per watt than the Surface Pro 6,\" Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay said during the event. Panay characterized the chip as having \"Snapdragon mobile DNA, alongside an integrated AI accelerator.\" That\\'s how Surface Pro X is able to offer 13 hours of battery life -- even more than Apple\\'s iPad Pro -- in a thinner and lighter form factor compared to the Surface Pro 7.\\nMicrosoft is playing some details close to the vest, declining to discuss what aspects of the silicon have been customized. \"Together with Qualcomm we also redesigned the GPU and other pieces of silicon IP which I want to say but I\\'m not allowed to,\" Panay\\xa0said.\\nQualcomm wants to challenge Intel in PCs with its Snapdragon 8cx platform. Image source: Qualcomm.\\nThe SQ1 is a customized\\xa0variant of Qualcomm\\'s Snapdragon 8cx, the platform\\xa0that represents Qualcomm\\'s latest attempt to make chips for the Windows PC market. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said\\xa0in August that the company is \"on track to see the first of Snapdragon 8cx-based designs to launch in the second half of calendar year 2019.\"\\nIn contrast, the Surface Pro 7 that was also unveiled uses a 10th-generation Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) chip and lacks a cellular connection. In terms of sheer performance, the Intel part should come out ahead, particularly for traditional Windows desktop apps that are already designed for that architecture.\\nIt\\'s now been six years since Microsoft released the last ARM-based Surface, the Surface 2. Microsoft has tried numerous times over the years to get Windows on ARM with little success, but it\\'s not giving up quite yet.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, stocks rebounded from the morning lows, giving investors confidence a bounce may ensue. Let’s look at a few top stock trades.\\xa0\\n\\nShares of Apple (NASDAQ:) failed to breakout over the $226 area, but are holding up well given the overall temperature of the market.\\xa0\\nOn a pullback, I was hoping to see the $215 level. Apple traded down to $215.13 on the day, before ricocheting higher back over $220. That’s just what the doctor ordered!\\nThe $215 level and 50-day moving average are important for the bulls to maintain. Below opens up Apple to further selling pressure and technical damage. \\nFrom here, let’s see if AAPL can maintain above the 20-day moving average. If it can, another test of $226 could be in the cards.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nJPMorgan (NYSE:) broke out to new highs last month, but has been struggling to maintain altitude. Unfortunately, the stock couldn’t hold up over prior resistance near $115, nor the 78.6% retracement and 20-day moving average.\\xa0\\nHowever, after briefly breaking below the 50-day moving average, shares were able to recover. Let’s see how the bank does going forward. Does it bounce and rally up to the 78.6% retracement and 20-day moving average? Or do shares continue lower to the 61.8% near $109? \\nI would love a deeper correction down to the $106 area and 200-day moving average for a longer-term buy.\\xa0\\n\\nSnap (NYSE:) remains as volatile as ever. A September breakout reversed itself, temporarily plunging the stock in just a few days. Then in just eight sessions, shares went from almost making new highs, to falling more than 20% from peak to trough.\\xa0\\nMan, this is a tough one to pin down. However, with Thursday’s reversal off the lows, bulls may consider a long position with a stop-loss either at the day’s low or at the 61.8% retracement, depending on how aggressive they want to be.\\xa0\\nHolding above $14 is a good sign, and should Snap hurdle prior downtrend resistance (blue line), then a move back to the 78.6% retracement is possible.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOn Wednesday,  the impressive relative strength in Lennar (NYSE:). But another stock showing relative strength is Proofpoint (NASDAQ:).\\xa0\\n because not only are these stocks holding up the best in a tough tape, but they are often the ones that do the best when the overall market comes back to life.\\xa0\\nNotice how this one has been trading sideways between $130 resistance and $122/the 50-day moving average. A break over this range can send PFPT to the recent highs at $133, while a rally above can gain momentum as a possible breakout.\\xa0\\n\\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:) bounced right where InvestorPlace readers where looking for and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:) posted a strong bounce on Thursday from an unsurprising location.\\xa0\\nThe stock held uptrend support from August (blue line) and the 78.6% retracement. We flagged this spot on Twitter .\\xa0\\nWhile some reprieve from the selling is welcomed by the bulls, a further decline down to the 200-day moving average and August lows would have been more enticing for a stronger reversal.\\xa0\\nFailure to get there now only leaves it as a possibility for a later date. It doesn’t mean we have to test this level, but it would have been healthier price action in my view.\\xa0\\nFrom here, let’s see if the SPY can reclaim the 50-day moving average and prior resistance from August. If it can’t, another test of uptrend support is in the cards. Over the 50-day puts the Fed-day low in the cards.\\xa0\\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL.\\xa0\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

We\\'re about one month away from the launch of Apple\\'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Disney\\'s (NYSE: DIS) streaming video services. And while they are priced to move at $4.99 to $6.99 per month, respectively, that extra entertainment money is going to come from somewhere.\\nThe problem will compound when consumers are given even more choices with the introductions of HBO Max from AT&T\\'s (NYSE: T) WarnerMedia and Peacock from Comcast\\'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal early next year. Not only will there be two more premium options for consumers to choose, but those services are also expected to be more expensive than Apple TV+ or Disney+.\\nThat said, management from nearly every company with a stake in the game is confident that its service will thrive. And with good reason. Consumers are showing an increasing willingness to subscribe to multiple video services, and early demand has surpassed expectations. But people don\\'t have an unlimited budget, in terms of time or money, so where will that consumer spending come from?\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nIf someone can stream more of the content they love, the first thing they\\'ll stop doing is paying for individual downloads. The music industry has seen a huge impact on digital downloads now that practically every song is available as part of an all-you-can-listen buffet. Streaming music accounted for 80% of the industry\\'s revenue in the U.S. during the first half of 2019. Digital download revenue fell from $2.3 billion in 2013 to $1 billion last year.\\nThe streaming video industry isn\\'t quite the same as streaming music. But as more content becomes available on streaming platforms, the less content people will take from digital downloads.\\nHere\\'s the rub. Digital download and rental sales have already fallen off the cliff. Self-reported rental and download spend in the U.S. has been cut in half since 2012, according to Parks Associates. The average consumer claims to spend only a couple of bucks a month on downloads.\\nSo while companies with digital video stores like Apple or Amazon.com\\xa0could see a further decline in downloads, there\\'s not much farther to fall.\\nThere are two other areas of home video that could see a significant impact from the plethora of streaming video options available: DVD and Blu-ray sales and pay-TV subscriptions.\\nBelieve it or not, people still buy DVDs and Blu-rays. Disney generates billions from physical sales of its catalog every year. But when every Disney movie becomes available for streaming, the appeal of the shelf full of boxes for baby to pick out becomes less appealing. That represents a huge opportunity for Disney to attract a large group of consumers to Disney+, but it comes at the cost of cannibalization.\\nNot every media company has home video sales as strong as Disney\\'s, but giving customers another way to watch their favorite films or series without needing to buy physical media will surely cut into those sales. That also means companies like Disney, with greater home entertainment sales, have a greater risk as more entertainment transitions to streaming.\\nThe bigger entertainment budget for most households, however, still goes toward a pay-TV subscription. The average pay-TV household spends over $100 per month on its subscription. Cutting or shaving the cord will open a considerable budget for streaming video.\\nThe losers here are traditional cable providers such as Comcast and AT&T. Disney may be a winner with its relatively low-cost Hulu + Live TV subscription, but investors should expect cord-cutting to keep declining considerably as more premium streaming options come to market. Comcast is reportedly going to offer the Peacock service free with ads to its cable subscribers as an effort to prevent cord-cutting, but it\\'ll also offer the service ad-free for a price.\\nOne challenge both consumers and analysts have with evaluating the streaming video industry is mental accounting. The idea that if consumers spend a certain amount on home entertainment per month they\\'ll only ever spend that amount per month is a fallacy. Spending will go up and down depending on a number of factors. Importantly, none of those factors are \"how much did I spend on streaming video last month?\"\\nIn other words,\\xa0Netflix\\xa0doesn\\'t have to lose for Disney+ to win. And consumers don\\'t have to cut the cord just because they want HBO Max.\\nThe average household spends more on eating out and drinking than on entertainment, both in-home and out-of-home. It spends nearly three times as much on transportation. Maybe one fewer trip to a restaurant per month will open the budget for spending on a few new streaming services.\\nWhile digital downloads and pay-TV will continue to suffer as more streaming services come to market and streaming gains popularity, most consumers won\\'t drastically change their behavior around other sources of entertainment. They might, however, shift their whole budget around to prioritize the things they want most. So whichever services offer a compelling content catalog are very likely to succeed despite other well-established and popular competitors in the market.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than Walt DisneyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rumors of Surface-branded earbuds arose\\xa0earlier this year. The announcement comes a year after the enterprise software giant unveiled Surface Headphones, a set of premium over-ear headphones with adjustable noise-cancellation technology, and a week after Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) revealed its Echo Buds.\\nOf course, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is credited with creating the hearables market with its popular AirPods. Here\\'s how Surface Earbuds stack up against the competition.\\nImage source: Microsoft.\\nThe Surface Earbuds\\xa0are designed with two microphones built into each earbud to take phone calls and facilitate voice dictation. There\\'s a carrying case that also charges the earbuds, which allows them to get 24 hours of battery life when including the juice inside the case. Each bud has a touch surface that can register various taps and gestures, which can be used to perform functions such as control Spotify on Android phones. Users can access Cortana or other virtual assistants, too.\\nSee the all-new Surface Earbuds. #MicrosoftEvent @rmseiler pic.twitter.com/4RO1lDCZHt\\n\\n\\nIn other words, Surface Earbuds are pretty much everything that you\\'d expect from a set of wireless earbuds in 2019. But there\\'s a twist: Surface Earbuds integrate\\xa0with Microsoft Office. The company is pitching Surface Earbuds as a productivity tool. They can transcribe speech into a Word document, control PowerPoint slideshows with gestures, access Outlook calendars, and translate languages in real time, among other features.\\nImage source: Microsoft.\\nSurface Earbuds are priced at the high end of the spectrum at $249 and will be available later this year. That puts them at a premium relative to both AirPods ($159 without the wireless charging case) and Echo Buds ($130), with Microsoft clearly hoping that the productivity features can justify the added cost for enterprise users.\\nConsidering the growth in the hearables market -- unit volumes soared 250% in the second quarter, according\\xa0to market researcher IDC -- it\\'s no wonder that tech companies large and small are jumping in. IDC estimates Apple grabbed 50% of the market in the second quarter, and the Mac maker has the strongest brand in hearables, according to Counterpoint Research.\\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google is next. The search juggernaut is hosting its own fall product event on Oct. 15 to show off its Pixel 4, and Google is also expected to unveil Pixel Buds 2, according to 9to5Google. They will be the company\\'s first true wireless earbuds (the first Pixel Buds don\\'t qualify as truly wireless because they are tethered together).\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Earlier this week, stocks slumped on news of some . However, today’s gains were accrued against the backdrop of more concerning data.\\nSource: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nToday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its services index fell to 52.6 in September, well below the prior month’s reading of 56.4 and far off economists’ estimate of a September reading of 55.1. Readings above 50 are considered healthy, but this is still a big miss and it won’t do much to allay recession concerns.\\nThe ISM services report is the latest in a recent spate of glum economic data. The tests continue tomorrow with the publication of the September jobs report from the Labor Department. With that in mind, today’s market upside may be a simple case of a rebound after a couple of bad days or expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again later this month.\\nToday, the Nasdaq Composite snapped back to gain 1.12% while the S&P 500 climbed 0.80%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.47% with 18 of its member firms pointed higher in late trading. Of those 18, roughly half were up about 1% or more.\\nPfizer (NYSE:), a rare visitor to this space, was the Dow’s top performer today, adding 2.22% on light news. The blue chip pharmaceuticals name is the epitome of a healthcare laggard this year with a loss of more than 20%.\\nThere wasn’t much news behind the Pfizer rally today, but earlier this week the company said it reached a settlement with Genentech and Roche so that Pfizer can introduce its biosimilar bevacizumab, Zirabev, .\\nPfizer still needs to gain 13.17% to reclaim its 200-day moving average.\\nIt’s been a while since United Technologies (NYSE:) was highlighted here, but shares of the industrial conglomerate posted a modest gain today on some encouraging remarks from Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. A case can be made that UTX should have been up more today because the analyst is forecasting upside of as much as 37% from current levels.\\nUnited Technologies is still working through its merger with Raytheon (NYSE:) and spin offs of its Otis Elevator and Carrier HVAC units, so there’s a lot of complexity and moving parts to the long thesis for the shares, but as Barron’s points out, there could also be considerable upside.\\n“It is a complicated exercise, but Spingarn said United Tech stock would be worth $164 and Raytheon $230 based on value to be received in a 2020 merger,” according to the financial magazine. “That is about 25% and 20% higher than current stock values, respectively. What’s more, he see upside to $180 for United Tech stock, 37% higher than recent levels, if management executes successfully on growth plans.”\\n\\nWhen talking about Dow technology stocks and product events, the conversation usually involves Apple (NASDAQ:), but today Microsoft (NASDAQ:) is the name to discuss.\\nAfter tumbling yesterday following a product launch session in New York, shares of Microsoft bounced back today. What’s happening here is that the company is making a push into the hardware arena. Specifically, it’s renewing its smartphone push with a foldable version of the Surface, known as the Surface Duo.\\nThose familiar with Microsoft know the company has a spotty history in the mobile phone arena, one littered with more failures than successes. The Duo, which is expected to be available in time for the 2020 holiday shopping season, won’t run on Windows. Rather, it will run on Google’s (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\\xa0Android operating system.\\nIndustry observers are already saying marketing for Duo will be essential and it remains to be seen if Microsoft markets the product as a true smartphone or a tablet from which users can make and take calls.\\nOverall, Thursday was a decent day and the first one of that nature since the fourth quarter starter. However, risks linger, namely due to these troubling economic data points. As one potential harbinger of ongoing weakness, oil prices have fallen for eight consecutive days. That would not be happening if market participants were enthusiastic about the global economy.\\nBarclays was out with a note today saying there’s a 25% to 30% chance of recession over the next 12 months. Those aren’t short odds, but they probably can’t be ignored either.\\nTodd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

HMC announced its fiscal 2019 performance Sept. 27. The $40.9 billion endowment gained 6.5% in the fiscal year ended June 30, down  from 2018.\\xa0\\nAlthough HMC is in the middle of an overhaul of its investment portfolio — N.P. Narvekar was  to head up the university’s investment management team — it has made big strides in the last 33 months repositioning the endowment’s assets for long-term success.\\nHistorically, HMC has generated an annualized total return of  since its founding 45 years ago, which is an excellent long-term track record. The fact is, every successful investor goes through a losing streak or a period of underperformance. Harvard is no different.\\xa0\\nOnce Narvekar completes his portfolio overhaul, investors can expect the endowment to be at the top of the performance charts once more.\\xa0In the meantime, here are  owned by Harvard Management Company.\\xa0\\n\\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:GOOG) is the largest of the 17 holdings reported by HMC at the end of June with 112,346 shares of the company’s Class A shares. The market value of those shares ($121.6 million) accounted for 30.0% of the  in assets listed by HMC.\\nIt’s important to remember that the $121 million investment is a small part of the endowment fund’s total portfolio. In 2018, for example, public equities accounted for 31% of the entire endowment. Yet, because HMC has invested most of those funds through outside investment managers, very few of its overall investments appear in SEC filings.\\xa0\\nNonetheless, the parent of Google is HMC’s largest holding in its 13-F. In May, I listed “.” Of those reasons, I would say that my three favorite reasons in no particular order would be healthy revenue growth, Google Cloud, and its massive free cash flow.\\xa0\\nDespite generating 33% of the online global ad revenue, it is still growing them at more than 30% a quarter. It is this kind of healthy revenue growth that’s led to  in trailing 12-month free cash flow, allowing it to reinvest in growth businesses such as Google Cloud.\\xa0When it comes to generating profits and cash flow, there aren’t many stocks better at it than Alphabet.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nThe maker of iPhones is HMC’s second-largest holding at 506,683 shares worth $100.3 million. Since HMC’s second-quarter filing at the end of June, Apple (NASDAQ:) stock has generated a 13.8% return for the endowment over the past three months. When its next 13-F comes out in November, its AAPL holdings ought to be closer to $114 million.\\xa0\\nHMC first acquired  of Apple stock in the first quarter of 2018. It has since scaled that back to less than a third of its original holdings. Apple stock has gained 33% in the 21 months between the end of 2017 and the end of September, an annualized return of almost 19%, not including dividends.\\xa0\\nInvestorPlace contributor Wayne Duggan recently highlighted the fact that  for Apple’s iPhone 11 has been very positive with pre-order activity in China, almost double what it was a year ago.\\xa0\\nWith more than 65 million iPhone users in China in need of an upgrade according to analysts, Apple skeptics might want to tone done their rhetoric a little. The demise of the iPhone’s been greatly exaggerated.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nFor HMC’s third-largest position, we go from two tech companies to a travel company that uses technology to bring travel providers together with consumers and businesses.\\xa0\\nAt a market cap of almost $84 billion, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:), once known as Priceline because of its name-your-price feature for booking air travel, is now focusing more of its energy on the hotel and apartment rental business.\\xa0\\nIn February, Skift, an online magazine dedicated to the business of travel, detailed how Booking Holdings was in a dead heat with Airbnb in the world of alternative accommodations.\\xa0\\n“Booking also revealed that it generated $2.8 billion in alternative accommodations revenue in 2018, accounting for 20 percent of the company’s overall revenue and that the business is ‘nicely profitable,’  Dennis Schaal. It’s one of the many reasons I recently named BKNG one of the seven stocks to buy benefiting from millennial money.\\xa0\\n“Just because they [Millennials] want to travel, doesn’t mean they want to do it in the same manner as their parents,”  Sept. 12.\\xa0 “Therefore, for travel companies to be successful, they’ve got to provide a combination of unique experiences, budget prices, and excellent customer service; three things that aren’t easy to deliver.”\\nAs long as millennials continue to enjoy traveling, I’d expect HMC to continue to hang on to Booking Holdings.\\n\\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nFacebook (NASDAQ:) is HMC’s fourth-largest holding with 170,081 shares and a June 30 market value of $32.8 million.\\xa0\\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to Harvard before \\xa0so that he could run his social media company on a full-time basis. Now he’s worth $69.0 billion or 50% more than Harvard’s entire endowment.\\xa0How’s that for irony?\\nRecently, Zuckerberg addressed Facebook employees over concerns that 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren would break up the company if elected. Zuckerberg is reported to have  that if Warren tries to break up the company, it would challenge the Senator’s plans in court — and win.\\xa0\\nWarren didn’t back down, suggesting that companies like Facebook, which trample on people’s privacy rights, ought to be taken to task.\\xa0\\nEarlier this year, I suggested that , but it’s a terrible company. I don’t think anything has changed to alter my opinion.\\xa0\\nHMC clearly owns FB stock because of its position within the online advertising industry and the profits these ads generate and not because  an honorary degree in 2017.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nOf HMC’s eight stocks held, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:) is the fifth-largest holding with 54,006 shares and a June 30 market value of $11.0 million.\\nThe California company specializes in cybersecurity products including firewall protection, endpoint protection, cloud security, and cybersecurity analytics. You would think in today’s world of computer security breaches, a company like Palo Alto would have a top-performing stock.\\xa0\\nUnfortunately, that hasn’t been the case for PANW, which generated a  over the past year, significantly worse than the total return (45.4%) of its application software peers.\\xa0One reason for Palo Alto’s lack of performance could be the competitive threats from newer entrants in the cybersecurity marketplace.\\xa0\\n“So I think the competition is Zscaler,” Palo Alto Chief Technology Officer Nir Zuk said in its . “However, I strongly believe that the right architecture and the right products at the end of the day win.”\\nThe fact that HMC holds Palo Alto and not Zscaler suggests it believes PANW will be the ultimate winner.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nOf HMC’s 17 holdings from its 13-F, nine are ETFs, with the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:) its largest holding with 72,147 shares and a June 30 market value of $21.3 million.\\xa0\\nWhat’s interesting about HMC holding IVV is that it’s doing precisely what Warren Buffett suggests most individual investors ought to do: buy the stocks of America’s largest companies and never stop buying.\\n“The trick is not to pick the right company, the trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low cost way,” Buffett  in May 2017.\\xa0\\nWell, IVV has a management expense ratio of just 0.04%. Even a big investment manager like HMC can’t do better than four basis points for 500 of America’s largest companies.\\nIn fact, iShares uses IVV as  to create a core portfolio of stocks and bonds for conservative, moderate, and aggressive investors. Under a really aggressive portfolio with 100% stocks and no bonds, IVV would account for 32% of the portfolio. If you can’t beat them, join them.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nThe Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:) is an excellent complement to the IVV because it invests in a group of large-, mid-, and small-cap companies in developed countries such as Canada, while excluding the U.S.\\xa0\\nIt tracks the performance of the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index holding  with 53% of the companies from Europe, another 37% from the Pacific region, and Canada and several other countries accounting for the rest.\\xa0\\nThe ETF’s top 10 holdings account for 10.5% of the fund’s $70.4 billion in total net assets. The median market cap of its 3,959 holdings is $27.5 billion, making VEA very much a large-cap ETF dressed up as an all-cap fund.\\xa0HMC owns 329,167 shares of VEA, the second-largest holding of its nine ETFs, and has a market value of $13.7 million.\\xa0\\nVEA and IVV have 3-year total returns of 6.3% and 13.4%, respectively, providing investors of all types with a good one-two punch.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

The tech giant’s shares have also jumped over 5% this week as Wall Street seems pleased with Apple’s latest round of iPhones and its streaming TV plans.\\niPhone Updates\\nApple unveiled its newest iPhones at its now customary pre-holiday shopping season event on Tuesday, led by CEO Tim Cook and other top executives. The firm showed off three new iPhones, under the new 11 branding.\\nThe smartphones feature Apple’s somewhat standard updates, which include better battery life and faster processors. What separates the two new higher-priced smartphones (iPhone 11 Pro & 11 Pro Max: starting at $999) from their less expensive peer (iPhone 11: starting at $699), is a triple-camera system. Apple also dropped the price of last year’s iPhone XR by 20% ($599), with the iPhone 8 starting at $449.\\nConsumers might be more prone to buy the higher-end iPhone 11s because the price points roughly match last year’s new high-end models—after years of rising prices. Perhaps more importantly, the new iPhone 11 base model is actually $50 cheaper than last year’s comparable offering. Clearly, Apple wants to give consumers every reason possible to upgrade to new phones after a year of poor iPhone sales, especially since there is nothing earth-shattering about the new phones.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nApple TV+ & Services\\xa0 \\nWall Street, investors, and Apple fans have waited for more details on Apple’s foray into the streaming TV world for months. They now have all they can hope for until they get to use the streaming service for the first time on November 1—Disney+ debuts on Nov. 12. Anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other qualifying devices will get a year worth of Apple TV+ for free. The service will otherwise cost $4.99 per month, after a seven-day free trial and be available on the Apple TV app.\\nApple’s streaming TV offering is clearly priced to move, as it comes in well below HBO Go’s T $14.99 per month, Netflix’s NFLX $15.99 premium plan, Amazon AMZN Prime’s $12.99—which comes with shipping perks—and Disney+ at $6.99. Aside from trying not to force users into a decision between Apple+ or Netflix, the price-point represents how little content will be available at launch.\\nApple TV+ will feature roughly 10 shows at launch, including a fictional space race-era show called For All Mankind, a show starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell titled The Morning Show, and post-apocalyptic drama See. \\xa0\\nApple will then slowly build up its library of shows, which is set to feature more A-list Hollywood stars both in front of and behind the camera. The iPhone maker is also likely viewing Apple TV+ as a kind of loss-leader for now, since it reportedly spent roughly $15 million an episode to make See.\\nApple is making a long-term play to convert more of its roughly 1 billion hardware users into services customers. This business, which includes its app store, Spotify SPOT challenger Apple Music, a monthly magazine-heavy news service, and an Apple credit card, will also soon feature Apple Arcade. The company’s big push into the video game world will feature access to roughly 100 titles for $4.99 per month and launch on September 19. Apple hopes to grab a piece of the $68.5 billion global mobile game market.\\nWhat Else?\\nThe ongoing U.S. and China trade war spooked some Apple investors early, but Cook has been in constant contact with President Trump and its biggest products have remained untouched. Plus, the last few days have seen both China and the U.S. slightly change their tunes as the two sides prepare to meet once again in a few weeks.\\nApple’s iPhone sales did slip in each of the last three quarters, as did the firm’s Greater China revenue. The company has found it harder to sell its higher-priced smartphones in a market with so many less expensive options available.\\nMeanwhile, iPhone sales slipped on the back of hard to compare periods, which means a 2020 turn around could be in store. In fact, Apple’s sales popped 1% last quarter (Q3 fiscal 2019) after revenue slipped 5.1% in Q2 and 4.5% in Q1.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nQ4 Outlook & Beyond \\nLooking ahead, Apple’s fourth-quarter 2019 revenue is projected to slip 0.56% from the year-ago period to $62.55 billion, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates. This, however, comes against Q4 2018’s 20% top-line expansion. Overall, AAPL’s full-year fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to dip 2.7% to reach $258.28 billion.\\nApple’s first quarter 2020 revenue, which includes the key holiday shopping period, is expected to jump 1.5% to $85.54 billion. Peeking further ahead, AAPL’s fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to climb 3.8% above our 2019 estimate to touch $268.01 billion and top 2018’s figure.\\nAt the bottom end of the income statement, Apple is expected to see its Q4 earnings sink 2.75%, with full-year 2019’s EPS figure set to fall 1.85%. Then, Apple’s Q1 2020 earnings are projected to surge 6.2% over the prior-year quarter, with full-year 2020 expected to come in 11.5% above our 2019 estimates.\\nBottom Line\\nAlong with Apple’s strong 2020 growth outlook, the firm has seen its earnings estimate revision picture trend heavily upward recently, especially for Q4 and fiscal 2019. AAPL is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment that sports an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system.\\nWe can see that Apple has traded at a higher forward price/sales ratio over the last year (4.2 vs. current 3.8). More importantly, Apple is the only of the so-called FAANG stocks that pays a dividend. The company’s current annualized dividend is $3.08 per share, for a 1.38% yield. This compares relatively favorably to the 10-year U.S. Treasury note’s 1.7%.\\nApple also has over $200 billion in cash on hand, which means it is likely to continue its massive buyback program. Therefore, investors should consider AAPL stock as a safe-haven investment, amid our current market uncertainty, with the added potential for big gains.\\nBreakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential\\nThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.

On Wednesday, it unveiled a new lineup of Surface-branded devices, including some refreshed hardware and a few entirely new products.\\xa0\\nThe event featured a total of six new Surface products, four of which will be launched this holiday season. Two will arrive toward the end of next year.\\nMicrosoft headquarters. Image source: Microsoft.\\nMicrosoft\\'s new products include:\\nThe Surface Laptop 3, Surface Pro 7, Surface Pro X, and Surface Earbuds are available for pre-order today in select markets and will debut this holiday season. But the products that will be available next year -- the all-new Surface Neo and Duo -- were the most surprising announcements on Wednesday.\\nHere\\'s a closer look at both devices.\\nThe Surface Neo and Surface Duo represent Microsoft\\'s bet on a new category of dual-screen devices. With two foldable screens, \"Neo and Surface Duo are optimized for the way we naturally multi-task, helping people get more done on the go,\" Microsoft said in a press release. (No prices were announced for either.)\\nIn the foreground, left to right, are Microsoft\\'s new Surface Neo, Surface Duo, and Surface Earbuds. At rear, left to right, are the Surface Laptop 3, Surface Pro 7, and Surface Pro X. Image source: Microsoft.\\nMicrosoft has big ambitions with the Neo, which product chief Panos Panay called \"the next category\" during the product launch event.\\xa0\\nThe device\\'s two displays can work together or independently of each other. In addition, there\\'s a keyboard that attaches to the device magnetically. When the foldable device is open, users have a full 13-inch display.\\nAnother version of Microsoft\\'s vision for a dual-screen device is its new Surface Duo. It\\'s the company\\'s first attempt at a smartphone since it\\xa0shut down its Windows Phone business. Learning from its mistake of trying to compete in mobile operating systems against juggernauts Apple and Alphabet, the company created a new phone that runs on Alphabet\\'s Android operating system.\\n\"Surface Duo brings together the best of Microsoft productivity experiences, Android apps and Surface hardware design into a single device you can take anywhere,\" the company said.\\xa0\"And, yes, it makes phone calls.\"\\nThe Surface Duo features two thin 5.6-inch screens.\\nPerhaps by giving its users access to the Android app store, Microsoft will have a shot at capturing meaningful market share in the smartphone business this time around. But investors shouldn\\'t count on it. The smartphone business is extremely competitive. Apple recently released its own new smartphones, and Alphabet will likely announce new Pixel-branded smartphones during its Oct. 15 Made by Google event.\\xa0\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This year the return is a mere 2.43%.\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nBut unfortunately, this weakness is nothing new. Note that for the past five years, JNJ stock has gained an average of 6.5%\\nWhat’s going on here? There are a variety of factors. First of all, the company has a diverse set of mature businesses, which tends to result in lower growth on the top line. Next, it does not help that it has gotten tougher to come up with new drugs.\\nThen there is the nagging issue of litigation. The most notable example of this is the situation with the opioid epidemic. Johnson and Johnson recently lost a case in the Oklahoma state courts for $572 million. Later this week, the company agreed to settle a .\\nSo yes, all this sounds kind of bad, right? This is true. But I still think there are bullish factors with Johnson and Johnson stock.\\xa0 In fact, I think it’s a compelling value play that has the potential for providing much better returns in the years ahead.\\nSo, let’s take a look:\\nJohnson and Johnson has been around for over 130 years. This is certainly a testament to the company’s focus on creating long-term value and developing powerful franchises. Some of its iconic brands include Neutrogena, Aveeno, Tylenol, Motrin and Band-Aid. Keep in mind that 70% of sales come from products that have either number one or two global market positions.\\nThe company also has a massive platform, which serves one billion patients each day. In other words, JNJ should withstand any kind of adverse economic situation.\\nAccording to the annual shareholder letter from CEO Alex Gorsky: “We remain focused on leveraging our broad-based capabilities to continue to  across our entire portfolio, both in markets where we have greater opportunity to compete, as well as in the markets where we lead, which include our 26 platforms that each delivered a billion dollars or more in sales last year.”\\nOther than Microsoft (NASDAQ:), Johnson and Johnson has a AAA credit rating. Then again, the company has a long history of success. For 57 consecutive years, JNJ has increased its dividend (the current yield is 3%).\\n\\nBut might the opioid exposure have a major adverse impact on the company’s financial strength?\\xa0\\xa0Well, not necessarily so. David Reischer, attorney and operator of  stated:\\nThe fact that the judge found in favor of the state but only entered a $572 million judgment based on the legal theory of ‘public nuisance’ suggests that the judge was skeptical of the state’s legal theory and the extent of the company’s liability.\\nThe ‘public nuisance’ theory is not a strong legal argument that would lend itself to creating massive liability for Johnson & Johnson. The judge clearly recognized that opioids drugs are not a defective product, which typically is a needed component in order to make a liability claim. It is very easy to see that the defendants can argue that liability should mostly fall on the prescribing doctors and patients who abuse the drug.\\nJohnson and Johnson is one of the world’s biggest spenders on innovation. Last year, the company shelled out $10.8 billion on research and development.\\nBut of course, there has also been an aggressive mergers and acquisition strategy that has helped to bolster the platform. What’s more, there are the many partnerships. For example, JNJ has teamed up with Apple (NASDAQ:) to leverage mobile apps to help treat heart problems.\\nBut perhaps the most important driver is the pharma segment (which comprises the majority of total revenues), which has many promising candidates. Within the next few years, the company is expected to file 15 new drug applications as well as 40 for existing drugs. For example, the drug Niraparib – which is in development with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:) – is for prostate cancer. Note that it has already proven effective for ovarian cancer and has the potential for being a blockbuster.\\nAs InvestorPlace.com’s James Brumley has noted, JNJ’s “ than the market’s giving it credit for.” And that’s very good news in the long run for JNJ stock.\\nTom Taulli is the author of the book,\\xa0.\\xa0Follow him on Twitter at\\xa0@ttaulli.\\xa0As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

On the hardware front, the tech giant released the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max; the Apple Watch Series 5, and a new version of the entry-level iPad. But the tech company also shared more details on two of its upcoming services: Apple Arcade and Apple TV+.\\nWith the iPhone segment accounting for over half of Apple\\'s revenue, it was no surprise that the company\\'s latest versions were the main event for the keynote. But what was interesting is that it wasn\\'t necessarily the flagship iPhone that stole the show on Tuesday. Instead, it was the aggressive pricing of the new iPhone 11 and the subsequent price cut to the current iPhone XR that grabbed the spotlight.\\nHere\\'s a look at the newest iPhones, and why the competitive pricing was a narrative that caught investors\\' attention.\\n\\nThe iPhone 11. Image source: Apple.\\nAs was the case last year, the lineup is made up of three new iPhones: one lower-cost iPhone and two high-end models. To differentiate the two higher-end smartphones from the cheapest new one, Apple gave the more expensive models a \"Pro\" designation this year.\\nHere\\'s how the new lineup breaks down.\\niPhone 11 (starting at $699): In many ways, this is the successor to the iPhone XR that Apple launched last year. Priced lower than the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, it is available in more colors, has a liquid crystal display (LCD) instead of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) version on the higher-end models, and has a display that measures 6.1 inches.\\xa0Setting it apart from the iPhone XR, the new phone has a better camera, improved battery life, and Apple\\'s new A13 Bionic processor.\\niPhone 11 Pro (starting at $999):\\xa0Compared with the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro has a smaller display size of 5.8 inches.\\xa0But it has an OLED display, and an even better camera system than the iPhone 11. It also includes the latest A13 Bionic chip.\\niPhone 11 Pro Max (starting at $1,099): The new flagship iPhone replaces the iPhone XS Max. It is mostly the same as the iPhone 11 Pro but has a 6.5-inch display and five more hours of battery life compared with the iPhone XS Max, giving it the longest battery life of any iPhone.\\xa0\\nWhile the iPhone 11 certainly isn\\'t cheap, it\\'s notably priced $50 lower than the iPhone XR\\'s $749 starting price last year. Perhaps even more surprising, Apple dropped the price of its one-year-old iPhone XR by $150, to $599.\\nThe aggressive pricing could give the iPhone segment a much-needed boost. Its revenue has been declining, and iPhone unit sales, which the company stopped reporting as they started to trend downward, are likely still falling as well.\\nAs Apple transitions to a business model that is focused on monetizing its base of active users with an increasingly robust slate of services, it makes sense to make its iPhones more affordable. This could reinvigorate unit sales growth, which could ultimately bolster the company\\'s installed base of active users, who it can monetize with apps and services in the coming years.\\n\\xa0\\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It just did.\\nApple TV+ will cost only $4.99 per month, and it\\'s free for a year when someone buys an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. The company made the announcement Sept. 10 during its annual event that\\'s often highlighted with new iPhone announcements. (There was that, too.)\\nApple joins the streaming wars Nov. 1, and the monthly price is lower than its fellow ad-free competition, which includes blue chip companies like\\xa0Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Disney+\\xa0(NYSE: DIS), Amazon Prime Video\\xa0(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Hulu (also Disney).\\nApple CEO Tim Cook prepares to show the trailer for the Apple original See. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE\\nApple\\'s decision was a good one for a few key reasons: The company doesn\\'t have a content library that matches the competition; its low price and free subscription offer could help sell hardware; and the price is low enough that Apple may not have to beat the competition -- subscribers may simply see it as an inexpensive add-on to their video streaming services.\\nApple is banking on name recognition to attract customers.\\nSteve Carell, Jennifer Aniston, and Reese Witherspoon will all be on Apple TV+ -- and that\\'s just one program, The Morning Show. Oprah Winfrey will have a show, and Steven Spielberg brings his anthology Amazing Stories.\\xa0Jason Momoa, of\\xa0Aquaman and\\xa0Game of Thrones fame,\\xa0stars in\\xa0See.\\nThe starting lineup looks strong, but Apple has no content bench, which helps explain the low price. Apple is expected to launch with just nine shows, which doesn\\'t compare to the massive content libraries from its top rivals.\\nApple will be rolling out new shows in the ensuing months, but to charge a monthly price similar to Netflix ($12.99 standard plan), Disney+ (launching Nov. 12 at $6.99), Amazon Prime ($12.99, with the dual value of free delivery), or Hulu ($11.99) wouldn\\'t have made sense -- especially considering more content-rich competition is on the way. Comcast\\'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal is launching Peacock in April and AT&T\\'s (NYSE: T) WarnerMedia is expected to launch HBO Max in the spring.\\xa0\\nApple CEO Tim Cook emphasized the price of the company\\'s new streaming service. \"This is crazy,\" he said, as the audience in the Steve Jobs Theater cheered.\\nIt\\'s not crazy. While Apple TV+ falls in line with the company\\'s long-term strategy of increasing services revenue, it also could spur additional iPhone sales. As the holiday season approaches, a free year of Apple TV+ may be the little incentive that convinces some customers to upgrade their iPhone, or buy one for the first time. That\\'s important, because iPhone sales, Apple\\'s biggest source of revenue, have continued to decline -- down 12% year over year in the most recent quarter.\\nEven if the streaming service doesn\\'t boost iPhone sales, Apple still will sell tens of millions of devices in the holiday season, and those customers will get a free year of Apple TV+. That could help quickly build a customer base that will be up for automatic subscription renewals in 12 months. The subscriptions could become a source of recurring revenue. If Apple\\'s content proves popular, the company eventually could raise prices.\\nGiving away subscriptions wasn\\'t met favorably by everyone on Wall Street. A Goldman Sachs analyst believes they will negatively affect earnings, and lowered his price target for the stock as a result.\\xa0Apple disputed the assessment, issuing a statement saying that the service wouldn\\'t materially impact earnings.\\nIn either case, it\\'s a short-term issue with little bearing on Apple\\'s long-term strategy. The company wants to attract customers to its services ecosystem, where they could find Apple Arcade ($4.99 per month) or Apple Music ($9.99 per month for an individual plan) as appealing options, too.\\nWith so many streaming options and not enough time to watch them all, how will someone choose? Apple made its service so cheap that customers may not face an either-or decision when it comes to Apple or a competitor. It\\'s possible they will choose both -- and probably a third one, according to the 13th edition of Deloitte\\'s digital media trends survey.\\nThe survey found that consumers subscribe to an average of three paid video streaming services, and 57% of respondents said they subscribed for content they couldn\\'t get anywhere else. That number grew to 71% among millennials. That\\'s one reason why Apple reportedly committed $6 billion for original content, still only half of what Netflix spent ($12.04 billion) in 2018 alone.\\nApple can afford the investment. It had nearly $211 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. That cash gives the company flexibility to spend, and to absorb short-term losses as it tries to build a subscriber base among its more than 1.4 billion active iOS devices to challenge Netflix\\'s 151 million worldwide subscribers.\\xa0\\nApple\\'s cash hoard also could give it a long-term competitive advantage. Content prices already are rising among streaming companies; and who wants to get into a bidding war with a company that has $200 billion in cash?\\xa0\\nApple enters the streaming wars at a competitive disadvantage. It doesn\\'t have Netflix\\'s audience or the proven, valuable content that Disney has been producing for generations.\\nTo attract viewers, Apple had to do something. Charging $5 a month and giving away year-long subscriptions was a smart strategy that seems almost certain to give Apple TV+ viewers. Then, it will be up to the content to keep them.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) investors have been anxious about those forthcoming services all year, with the stock having recently given\\xa0up all of its year-to-date gains ahead of the looming competition.\\nCEO Reed Hastings acknowledged\\xa0last month that it would be \"a whole new world starting in November.\" Hastings added, \"It\\'ll be tough competition.\" However, at least one Wall Street analyst isn\\'t too concerned.\\nImage source: Netflix.\\nPiper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson put out a research note\\xa0this week expressing confidence in Netflix\\'s ability to weather the competitive storm, based in part on a survey of Netflix subscribers that suggests the company should be able to retain the majority of its U.S. subscribers. The video-streaming leader had rattled investors over the summer when it reported its first U.S. subscriber loss in nearly a decade.\\n\"Our survey suggests that the majority (~75%) of Netflix subscribers do not intend to subscribe to either Disney+ or Apple TV+,\" Olson wrote in a note to investors. \"For those that do expect to use one of these offerings, the vast majority expect to also maintain their Netflix subscription.\"\\nImage source: Disney.\\nThere were approximately 1,500 respondents included in the survey, with most existing subscribers expressing little interest in the rival services: 77% of respondents weren\\'t interested in Apple TV+ and 72% felt the same way about Disney+. Video-streaming services aren\\'t entirely mutually exclusive, and many subscribers will sign up for numerous services.\\nIf anything, consumers are more likely to cut their cable budgets to make room for more over-the-top (OTT) services. \"Most existing Netflix subscribers appear to be trending toward multiple streaming video subscriptions, especially as many continue to reduce their spend on traditional TV offerings,\" the analyst said.\\nBesides, most Apple TV+ viewers probably won\\'t have to pay anything for a while, as the Cupertino tech giant is giving away a free year of service bundled with hardware purchases. With the holiday shopping season on the horizon, Apple will be giving away tens of millions of subscriptions over the next few months. At just $7 per month for Disney+, the House of Mouse is also taking an aggressive pricing strategy in order to make the service\\'s value proposition hard to resist.\\nOlson also noted that Netflix shares have hit \"multi-year valuation lows,\" suggesting that investors are already pricing in the competitive risks that the company is about to face. Piper Jaffray reiterated an overweight rating and $440 price target.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rumors of Surface-branded earbuds arose\\xa0earlier this year. The announcement comes a year after the enterprise software giant unveiled Surface Headphones, a set of premium over-ear headphones with adjustable noise-cancellation technology, and a week after Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) revealed its Echo Buds.\\nOf course, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is credited with creating the hearables market with its popular AirPods. Here\\'s how Surface Earbuds stack up against the competition.\\nImage source: Microsoft.\\nThe Surface Earbuds\\xa0are designed with two microphones built into each earbud to take phone calls and facilitate voice dictation. There\\'s a carrying case that also charges the earbuds, which allows them to get 24 hours of battery life when including the juice inside the case. Each bud has a touch surface that can register various taps and gestures, which can be used to perform functions such as control Spotify on Android phones. Users can access Cortana or other virtual assistants, too.\\nSee the all-new Surface Earbuds. #MicrosoftEvent @rmseiler pic.twitter.com/4RO1lDCZHt\\n\\n\\nIn other words, Surface Earbuds are pretty much everything that you\\'d expect from a set of wireless earbuds in 2019. But there\\'s a twist: Surface Earbuds integrate\\xa0with Microsoft Office. The company is pitching Surface Earbuds as a productivity tool. They can transcribe speech into a Word document, control PowerPoint slideshows with gestures, access Outlook calendars, and translate languages in real time, among other features.\\nImage source: Microsoft.\\nSurface Earbuds are priced at the high end of the spectrum at $249 and will be available later this year. That puts them at a premium relative to both AirPods ($159 without the wireless charging case) and Echo Buds ($130), with Microsoft clearly hoping that the productivity features can justify the added cost for enterprise users.\\nConsidering the growth in the hearables market -- unit volumes soared 250% in the second quarter, according\\xa0to market researcher IDC -- it\\'s no wonder that tech companies large and small are jumping in. IDC estimates Apple grabbed 50% of the market in the second quarter, and the Mac maker has the strongest brand in hearables, according to Counterpoint Research.\\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google is next. The search juggernaut is hosting its own fall product event on Oct. 15 to show off its Pixel 4, and Google is also expected to unveil Pixel Buds 2, according to 9to5Google. They will be the company\\'s first true wireless earbuds (the first Pixel Buds don\\'t qualify as truly wireless because they are tethered together).\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This year the return is a mere 2.43%.\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nBut unfortunately, this weakness is nothing new. Note that for the past five years, JNJ stock has gained an average of 6.5%\\nWhat’s going on here? There are a variety of factors. First of all, the company has a diverse set of mature businesses, which tends to result in lower growth on the top line. Next, it does not help that it has gotten tougher to come up with new drugs.\\nThen there is the nagging issue of litigation. The most notable example of this is the situation with the opioid epidemic. Johnson and Johnson recently lost a case in the Oklahoma state courts for $572 million. Later this week, the company agreed to settle a .\\nSo yes, all this sounds kind of bad, right? This is true. But I still think there are bullish factors with Johnson and Johnson stock.\\xa0 In fact, I think it’s a compelling value play that has the potential for providing much better returns in the years ahead.\\nSo, let’s take a look:\\nJohnson and Johnson has been around for over 130 years. This is certainly a testament to the company’s focus on creating long-term value and developing powerful franchises. Some of its iconic brands include Neutrogena, Aveeno, Tylenol, Motrin and Band-Aid. Keep in mind that 70% of sales come from products that have either number one or two global market positions.\\nThe company also has a massive platform, which serves one billion patients each day. In other words, JNJ should withstand any kind of adverse economic situation.\\nAccording to the annual shareholder letter from CEO Alex Gorsky: “We remain focused on leveraging our broad-based capabilities to continue to  across our entire portfolio, both in markets where we have greater opportunity to compete, as well as in the markets where we lead, which include our 26 platforms that each delivered a billion dollars or more in sales last year.”\\nOther than Microsoft (NASDAQ:), Johnson and Johnson has a AAA credit rating. Then again, the company has a long history of success. For 57 consecutive years, JNJ has increased its dividend (the current yield is 3%).\\n\\nBut might the opioid exposure have a major adverse impact on the company’s financial strength?\\xa0\\xa0Well, not necessarily so. David Reischer, attorney and operator of  stated:\\nThe fact that the judge found in favor of the state but only entered a $572 million judgment based on the legal theory of ‘public nuisance’ suggests that the judge was skeptical of the state’s legal theory and the extent of the company’s liability.\\nThe ‘public nuisance’ theory is not a strong legal argument that would lend itself to creating massive liability for Johnson & Johnson. The judge clearly recognized that opioids drugs are not a defective product, which typically is a needed component in order to make a liability claim. It is very easy to see that the defendants can argue that liability should mostly fall on the prescribing doctors and patients who abuse the drug.\\nJohnson and Johnson is one of the world’s biggest spenders on innovation. Last year, the company shelled out $10.8 billion on research and development.\\nBut of course, there has also been an aggressive mergers and acquisition strategy that has helped to bolster the platform. What’s more, there are the many partnerships. For example, JNJ has teamed up with Apple (NASDAQ:) to leverage mobile apps to help treat heart problems.\\nBut perhaps the most important driver is the pharma segment (which comprises the majority of total revenues), which has many promising candidates. Within the next few years, the company is expected to file 15 new drug applications as well as 40 for existing drugs. For example, the drug Niraparib – which is in development with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:) – is for prostate cancer. Note that it has already proven effective for ovarian cancer and has the potential for being a blockbuster.\\nAs InvestorPlace.com’s James Brumley has noted, JNJ’s “ than the market’s giving it credit for.” And that’s very good news in the long run for JNJ stock.\\nTom Taulli is the author of the book,\\xa0.\\xa0Follow him on Twitter at\\xa0@ttaulli.\\xa0As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

In recent years, tech giants have all been clamoring to design their own silicon in pursuit of various benefits,\\xa0including better optimization of performance and power efficiency, reduced product complexity, and streamlined cost structures.\\nAt this point, Alphabet subsidiary Google, Amazon.com, Facebook, and Tesla are all on the custom chip bandwagon, developing specialized processors designed for specific purposes. It\\'s Microsoft\\'s (NASDAQ: MSFT) turn to hop on.\\nSurface Pro X is powered by a custom SQ1 processor. Image source: Microsoft.\\nAt the company\\'s big hardware event yesterday, the enterprise software specialist announced the new flagship Surface Pro X, a powerful 2-in-1 hybrid device powered by a custom ARM-based SQ1\\xa0chip. Microsoft worked in collaboration with mobile chip behemoth Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to develop the processor, in part to add LTE connectivity to the device while also improving power efficiency.\\nMeet the new Surface ProX. #MicrosoftEvent @panos_panay pic.twitter.com/p4hpg0TZ0L\\n\\n\\n\"This product has three times more performance per watt than the Surface Pro 6,\" Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay said during the event. Panay characterized the chip as having \"Snapdragon mobile DNA, alongside an integrated AI accelerator.\" That\\'s how Surface Pro X is able to offer 13 hours of battery life -- even more than Apple\\'s iPad Pro -- in a thinner and lighter form factor compared to the Surface Pro 7.\\nMicrosoft is playing some details close to the vest, declining to discuss what aspects of the silicon have been customized. \"Together with Qualcomm we also redesigned the GPU and other pieces of silicon IP which I want to say but I\\'m not allowed to,\" Panay\\xa0said.\\nQualcomm wants to challenge Intel in PCs with its Snapdragon 8cx platform.

In terms of sheer performance, the Intel part should come out ahead, particularly for traditional Windows desktop apps that are already designed for that architecture.\\nIt\\'s now been six years since Microsoft released the last ARM-based Surface, the Surface 2.

Between its critical third-quarter earnings report in two weeks and the launch of new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Disney (NYSE: DIS) streaming video services next month, there are a lot of things that can go wrong for the premium streaming leader. One Wall Street pro seems to think the fallout could be severe unless Netflix tweaks its prices.\\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin feels that Netflix could shed as many as 10 million of its 60.1 million U.S. subscribers at its current monthly rates. With a year of Apple+ being bundled into new-device purchases at no additional cost, and Disney recently selling three-year prepaid plans to Disney+ for roughly $4 a month, it\\'s going to be difficult to stand out\\xa0with its standard plan\\'s monthly pricing of $12.99. Netflix seems out of touch, especially if the economy sours and consumers\\xa0brace for a recession. This could be a lose-lose situation for Netflix, but it pays not to underestimate what CEO Reed Hastings can do.\\nImage source: Netflix.\\nThe pricing war is real, and it\\'s easy to see why Netflix can feel the pinch next month with the Nov. 1 launch of Apple+ and Disney+ following less than two weeks later. Netflix at $12.99 a month has been a compelling value proposition for folks paying several times that amount to their cable and satellite television providers, but will those same deal seekers now flock to cheaper new services launching with top-shelf content?\\xa0\\nNetflix can respond with a price cut, but that would likely trigger an even bigger collapse in the stock than just the potential slow drain of high-paying members. There doesn\\'t seem a way out for Netflix, but there is a third option -- and a fourth, if you care to get creative.\\xa0\\nThe third option would be for Netflix to play the same game that Disney and Apple are playing. Offering a multiyear discount now -- before the launch of Apple+ and Disney+ muddle the marketplace -- would help lock in long-term Netflix customers, and it\\'s about the only case where the investing community would applaud what is effectively a price cut. With Netflix prices unlikely to rise in the near term given the suddenly cutthroat nature of this niche, discounted multiyear deals are not likely to cause huge concern among investors.\\xa0\\nAnother option would be to roll out a more affordable ad-supported version. Netflix has always resisted the urge to jam up its user experience with marketing missives, but it could be one way for it to offer a lower-priced plan without disrupting its premium positioning. As the undisputed top dog with more than a decade of streaming data, it\\'s fair to say that advertisers would love to get in on anything that Netflix may offer on that front. Needham\\'s Martin suggests that Netflix consider a $6 a month ad-saddled streaming plan.\\nNetflix ultimately has to do something. If can\\'t follow up its jarring\\xa0second-quarter subscriber miss\\xa0with another clunker later this month and no new ideas in hand. Locking in members with discounted multiyear plans, a cheaper ad-supported plan, or even a long overdue push into digital rentals\\xa0will be the only ways it can save its stock if the news will be unpleasant when it reports after the market close on Oct. 16.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It just did.\\nApple TV+ will cost only $4.99 per month, and it\\'s free for a year when someone buys an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. The company made the announcement Sept. 10 during its annual event that\\'s often highlighted with new iPhone announcements. (There was that, too.)\\nApple joins the streaming wars Nov. 1, and the monthly price is lower than its fellow ad-free competition, which includes blue chip companies like\\xa0Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Disney+\\xa0(NYSE: DIS), Amazon Prime Video\\xa0(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Hulu (also Disney).\\nApple CEO Tim Cook prepares to show the trailer for the Apple original See. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE\\nApple\\'s decision was a good one for a few key reasons: The company doesn\\'t have a content library that matches the competition; its low price and free subscription offer could help sell hardware; and the price is low enough that Apple may not have to beat the competition -- subscribers may simply see it as an inexpensive add-on to their video streaming services.\\nApple is banking on name recognition to attract customers.\\nSteve Carell, Jennifer Aniston, and Reese Witherspoon will all be on Apple TV+ -- and that\\'s just one program, The Morning Show. Oprah Winfrey will have a show, and Steven Spielberg brings his anthology Amazing Stories.\\xa0Jason Momoa, of\\xa0Aquaman and\\xa0Game of Thrones fame,\\xa0stars in\\xa0See.\\nThe starting lineup looks strong, but Apple has no content bench, which helps explain the low price. Apple is expected to launch with just nine shows, which doesn\\'t compare to the massive content libraries from its top rivals.\\nApple will be rolling out new shows in the ensuing months, but to charge a monthly price similar to Netflix ($12.99 standard plan), Disney+ (launching Nov. 12 at $6.99), Amazon Prime ($12.99, with the dual value of free delivery), or Hulu ($11.99) wouldn\\'t have made sense -- especially considering more content-rich competition is on the way. Comcast\\'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal is launching Peacock in April and AT&T\\'s (NYSE: T) WarnerMedia is expected to launch HBO Max in the spring.\\xa0\\nApple CEO Tim Cook emphasized the price of the company\\'s new streaming service. \"This is crazy,\" he said, as the audience in the Steve Jobs Theater cheered.\\nIt\\'s not crazy. While Apple TV+ falls in line with the company\\'s long-term strategy of increasing services revenue, it also could spur additional iPhone sales. As the holiday season approaches, a free year of Apple TV+ may be the little incentive that convinces some customers to upgrade their iPhone, or buy one for the first time. That\\'s important, because iPhone sales, Apple\\'s biggest source of revenue, have continued to decline -- down 12% year over year in the most recent quarter.\\nEven if the streaming service doesn\\'t boost iPhone sales, Apple still will sell tens of millions of devices in the holiday season, and those customers will get a free year of Apple TV+. That could help quickly build a customer base that will be up for automatic subscription renewals in 12 months. The subscriptions could become a source of recurring revenue. If Apple\\'s content proves popular, the company eventually could raise prices.\\nGiving away subscriptions wasn\\'t met favorably by everyone on Wall Street. A Goldman Sachs analyst believes they will negatively affect earnings, and lowered his price target for the stock as a result.\\xa0Apple disputed the assessment, issuing a statement saying that the service wouldn\\'t materially impact earnings.\\nIn either case, it\\'s a short-term issue with little bearing on Apple\\'s long-term strategy. The company wants to attract customers to its services ecosystem, where they could find Apple Arcade ($4.99 per month) or Apple Music ($9.99 per month for an individual plan) as appealing options, too.\\nWith so many streaming options and not enough time to watch them all, how will someone choose? Apple made its service so cheap that customers may not face an either-or decision when it comes to Apple or a competitor. It\\'s possible they will choose both -- and probably a third one, according to the 13th edition of Deloitte\\'s digital media trends survey.\\nThe survey found that consumers subscribe to an average of three paid video streaming services, and 57% of respondents said they subscribed for content they couldn\\'t get anywhere else. That number grew to 71% among millennials. That\\'s one reason why Apple reportedly committed $6 billion for original content, still only half of what Netflix spent ($12.04 billion) in 2018 alone.\\nApple can afford the investment. It had nearly $211 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. That cash gives the company flexibility to spend, and to absorb short-term losses as it tries to build a subscriber base among its more than 1.4 billion active iOS devices to challenge Netflix\\'s 151 million worldwide subscribers.\\xa0\\nApple\\'s cash hoard also could give it a long-term competitive advantage. Content prices already are rising among streaming companies; and who wants to get into a bidding war with a company that has $200 billion in cash?\\xa0\\nApple enters the streaming wars at a competitive disadvantage. It doesn\\'t have Netflix\\'s audience or the proven, valuable content that Disney has been producing for generations.\\nTo attract viewers, Apple had to do something. Charging $5 a month and giving away year-long subscriptions was a smart strategy that seems almost certain to give Apple TV+ viewers. Then, it will be up to the content to keep them.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Find out in MyWallSt\\'s free guide!\\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) is one of the most closely studied and followed stock portfolios on the planet and has thrived under the leadership of founder and stock market guru Warren Buffett.\\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\\nHere at MyWallSt, we have built our investment strategy around the ideology of Buffett himself: buy and hold \\'til we\\'re grey and old! This is the basic tenet of Buffett\\'s strategy: He believes in investing in companies with long-term value rather than a \"flash in the pan.\" We take a look at arguably the five best additions to the Buffett portfolio.\\nBerkshire Hathaway currently owns roughly 5% of the second-richest company on Earth, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). It also happens to be Berkshire\\'s top holding by quite a large margin, coming in at close to a $50 billion market value. Buffett first began buying up shares in Steve Jobs\\' brainchild in 2016 and has bought more shares every quarter since, with gains coming in at around 25% since its first purchase. Despite Apple\\'s declining hardware sales, Buffett firmly believes in the company\\'s \"stickiness,\" or the ability to remain relevant in everyday consumer life for years to come.\\nMuch of Berkshire\\'s enormous 9.3% stake in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) came about following the Great Recession of 2008. The investment mogul invested $5 billion into the struggling bank, purchasing the shares at a much-reduced price of $7.14 per share, well below the trading price at the time of $26.99 per share. With the bank growing back to its pre-recession heights, Buffett has seen the market value of his position in BofA grow to $26.7 billion, making it an extremely successful investment.\\nIt\\'s safe to say that Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) hasn\\'t been short of scandals in recent years, which has contributed to it being one of the worst-performing banks in the sector. However, through all of this, Warren Buffett has publicly backed his investment and its managers. Wells Fargo is one of Buffett\\'s oldest banking investments, which he bought in 1989 worth $3 per share. With CEO Tim Sloan resigning earlier this year, and its stock price seemingly beginning to become steady after a fluctuating year, the company looks to be on the path to recovery. Despite all this, it\\'s still one of Buffett\\'s top stocks, and he has actually had to sell shares to meet regulatory demands of remaining below 10% ownership, with the market value of his position coming in at close to $20 billion.\\nAnother golden oldie for Warren Buffet -- he purchased his first Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) stock back in 1988 at a time of struggle\\xa0-- that appears to still hold his seal of approval despite the changing landscape and growing health-consciousness of the average consumer. Buffett originally paid $1.3 billion for shares of the company, which translates to a current market value of roughly $18 billion, an increase of almost 1,300%. The investment pays Berkshire a massive $650 million per year and has seen increases in annual dividends almost annually for the past 50 years. It pays to own 9.5% of the world\\'s most recognizable beverage maker. Fun fact: Buffett is actually a massive fan of the drink itself, and claims to drink several cans a day.\\nIn a surprising move, Berkshire Hathaway recently bought a stake in e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). One of Buffett\\'s two lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, started a position in the first quarter of 2019, and then added shares in the second. Though not a typical Buffett stock, considering its high price and price-to-earnings ratio, the purchase was still a wise move, as Amazon does fit the Buffett model of compounding growth with a formidable moat. The dominant leader in e-commerce over the past 25 years, Amazon has grown into a massive empire including hardware, music, streaming, and more. Not only does its core delivery service control 50% of U.S. market share, but its subsidiaries such as Amazon Web Services are also dominating in their respective fields. It may be too early to call it a great Buffett investment, but it has all the signs of potentially being his greatest yet.\\nImage source: MyWallSt.\\nOne of these pot stocks is already\\xa0+100% this year.

Apple stock has been a buy for decades and a few weak ISM reports are not going to change this fact. There still is much more upside from here.\\nSource: thanat sasipatanapa / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nCritics call it an iPhone company and they point out that they are losing steam in that department. While this fact is correct, AAPL is in the process of shifting sales focus to services, thereby reducing their dependency on upgrade cycles of phones.\\nFurthermore, they are putting more effort into wearables, which will undoubtedly become the new way we communicate. They are long overdue because most of us only really need a smaller wearable smart device like an Apple Watch. There AAPL has a strong start as they have millions sold already, and therein lies another set of upgrade cycles. The watches have a cheaper price point so more people will upgrade them more often and it’s an easier sell.\\nYou’d be wrong to label me a perma-bull on AAPL stock as I can assure you that I trade it without any emotions. I personally do not like AAPL products and I definitely don’t think highly of Tim Cook. He is at best a marginal COO. AAPL would have done as well off even without a CEO since Steve Jobs untimely death.\\nI also think that Cook added over $100 billion in debt with almost nothing to show for other than financial engineering. I bet that Jeff Bezos would have found better uses for this cash that would have added a few verticals for new income streams — think AWS for Amazon (NASDAQ:).\\nBack to today’s point, Apple stock is still a safe bet for as long as the market-wide thesis is bullish. We have global central banks still 100% committed to inflating our economies. Add to it that politicians will do what they can to spruce up the economy in the U.S., and you get a bullish thesis that will not die so easily. I can never discount a black swan event, but shorting this momentum is easier said than done.\\nUnder this assumption I can go long AAPL stock now into its next earnings report. If my intentions are for the long term then I would only manage my risk after the binary earnings event later this month. Otherwise, I would place proper stops that match my time frames.\\nFor example, on the daily chart, $215.30 and $211.50 are spots where I expect support. There is also stronger support close to $202 per share. It is important to note that there are two small 120 minute gaps to $209.7 and $206 per share which could come into play if markets continue with this sentiment crisis.\\nAnother way I can get bullish Apple stock is by selling downside risk into what others fear. This way I won’t even need a rally to profit. For example, I can sell AAPL December $180 put and collect $2 for my efforts. So even if the stock falls 15% from here, I can still retain my maximum gains. Otherwise, I own the shares at a steep discount and won’t suffer losses until below $183 per share. To limit the downside risk I would sell a put spread instead.\\nAs for the earnings outcomes, they are binary. We don’t know what management will deliver or forecast, nor do we know how traders will react to them. Even if they give us the P&L in advance we couldn’t guess if it opens up or down the next day. But often the stock rallies into the earnings, so starting long now may give traders the opportunity to enter and exit before earnings. Those who want to own it for the long term need not worry so much about timing. Take positions in tranches and all will be fine with time.

However, there are still plenty of solid tech stocks that are well insulated from those headwinds, and that trade at attractive valuations.\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at three tech stocks that are \"no-brainer\" investment options\\xa0 -- Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Infinera (NASDAQ: INFN).\\nShares of Cisco, the world\\'s top maker of networking routers and switches, have fallen about 10% during the past two months. Most of that drop occurred in mid-August when the company followed up a solid fiscal fourth-quarter report with\\xa0soft guidance for its first quarter.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nCisco\\'s revenue and adjusted earnings rose\\xa07% and 20%, respectively, in fiscal 2019. But for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it expects its revenues to be in the flat to 2% higher range, and for its adjusted EPS to rise 7% to 9% year over year. For the full fiscal year, analysts expect its revenue will rise 2%, and for earnings to climb by 8%.\\nCisco faces tougher year-over-year comparisons in fiscal 2020, as well as decelerating enterprise spending in China, the U.S., and the U.K. due to macroeconomic headwinds like the trade war and Brexit. However, its higher-growth security and applications units (which accounted for 16% of its 2019 revenues) are still generating double-digit percentage sales growth. In fiscal Q4, 70% of its software revenues came from stickier subscriptions, and it only generates a tiny sliver of its sales from China. It also expects its gross and operating margins to hold steady in fiscal Q1, even as its revenue growth slows.\\nCisco still has some irons in the fire. It ended last quarter with $33.4 billion in cash and equivalents, and it recently agreed to buy Acacia Communications (NASDAQ: ACIA) -- one of its suppliers -- in a move that should cut costs and help it upgrade its networking device offerings for data centers. Its forward dividend yield of 2.9% and its forward P/E ratio of 13 should also set a floor under this unloved stock until the near-term headwinds fade.\\nApple today admittedly isn\\'t as innovative as it was under the late Steve Jobs. It\\'s also still too dependent on the iPhone, which generated 48% of its revenues last quarter. But under CEO Tim Cook, it is aggressively expanding its services ecosystem (21% of its sales) with new platforms like Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ -- which could\\xa0generate more revenue per user as its hardware sales decelerate.\\nIt\\'s also making progress in the wearables market with the Apple Watch and AirPods. Cook claimed that\\xa0Apple\\'s wearable sales surged \"well over 50%\" annually last quarter, accelerating from segment growth of\\xa0\"near 50%\" in the second quarter. The HomePod also claimed 5% of\\xa0the U.S. smart speaker market in June, according to research firm CIRP.\\nImage source: Apple.\\nThe initial reception for the new iPhone 11 has also been warm -- even in China, where Apple is struggling with local competition, an economic slowdown, and trade war-related tensions. Cook recently told German newspaper Bild that iPhone 11 sales were off to a \"very strong start.\"\\nAnalysts expect Apple\\'s revenue and earnings will rise 5% and\\xa09%, respectively, next year -- solid growth rates for a stock that trades at 18 times forward earnings. It also pays a\\xa0dividend with a forward yield of 1.8%.\\nMore importantly, Apple ended last quarter with $210.6 billion in cash and equivalents -- which gives it plenty of room for stock buybacks, dividend hikes, acquisitions, and investments in new products. That cash cushion, along with the strength of its brand, makes Apple one of the safest tech stocks to buy for the long term.\\nInfinera isn\\'t as well-known as Cisco or Apple. The optical transmission equipment maker\\xa0mainly sells wave division multiplexing (WDM) systems, which let internet service providers and telecoms increase the capacity of their existing networks without laying down additional fiber -- a cost-effective option for carriers dealing with the bandwidth demand that comes from the rising use of cloud-based services.\\nYet Infinera\\'s stock price plunged from $12 in May 2018 to about $3 in July 2019. There were two key reasons for that drop. First, demand for long-haul WDM systems, from which Infinera generates most of its revenue, dried up as service providers focused on shorter-range WDM solutions like metro and data center interconnect (DCI) systems. Second, its forecasts following its acquisition of Coriant -- a smaller rival which produces shorter-range WDM solutions -- were\\xa0initially too high.\\nHowever, the stock has rebounded by roughly 70% over the past three months as investors realized that its cyclical business was bottoming out and that the concerns about Coriant were likely overblown. Last quarter, Infinera\\'s revenue rose\\xa047% annually, compared to 46% growth in the first quarter. It expects that figure to accelerate again to somewhere in the 60% to 70% range in the third quarter, and for its gross margin to expand sequentially.\\nInfinera remains unprofitable, but it expects its synergies with Coriant to lift its free cash flow and adjusted profits back to positive levels by the fourth quarter. If it achieves those goals, its stock could rally much higher -- since its current market cap is less than this year\\'s sales.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Earlier this week, stocks slumped on news of some . However, today’s gains were accrued against the backdrop of more concerning data.\\nSource: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n \\nToday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its services index fell to 52.6 in September, well below the prior month’s reading of 56.4 and far off economists’ estimate of a September reading of 55.1. Readings above 50 are considered healthy, but this is still a big miss and it won’t do much to allay recession concerns.\\nThe ISM services report is the latest in a recent spate of glum economic data. The tests continue tomorrow with the publication of the September jobs report from the Labor Department. With that in mind, today’s market upside may be a simple case of a rebound after a couple of bad days or expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again later this month.\\nToday, the Nasdaq Composite snapped back to gain 1.12% while the S&P 500 climbed 0.80%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.47% with 18 of its member firms pointed higher in late trading. Of those 18, roughly half were up about 1% or more.\\nPfizer (NYSE:), a rare visitor to this space, was the Dow’s top performer today, adding 2.22% on light news. The blue chip pharmaceuticals name is the epitome of a healthcare laggard this year with a loss of more than 20%.\\nThere wasn’t much news behind the Pfizer rally today, but earlier this week the company said it reached a settlement with Genentech and Roche so that Pfizer can introduce its biosimilar bevacizumab, Zirabev, .\\nPfizer still needs to gain 13.17% to reclaim its 200-day moving average.\\nIt’s been a while since United Technologies (NYSE:) was highlighted here, but shares of the industrial conglomerate posted a modest gain today on some encouraging remarks from Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. A case can be made that UTX should have been up more today because the analyst is forecasting upside of as much as 37% from current levels.\\nUnited Technologies is still working through its merger with Raytheon (NYSE:) and spin offs of its Otis Elevator and Carrier HVAC units, so there’s a lot of complexity and moving parts to the long thesis for the shares, but as Barron’s points out, there could also be considerable upside.\\n“It is a complicated exercise, but Spingarn said United Tech stock would be worth $164 and Raytheon $230 based on value to be received in a 2020 merger,” according to the financial magazine. “That is about 25% and 20% higher than current stock values, respectively. What’s more, he see upside to $180 for United Tech stock, 37% higher than recent levels, if management executes successfully on growth plans.”\\n\\nWhen talking about Dow technology stocks and product events, the conversation usually involves Apple (NASDAQ:), but today Microsoft (NASDAQ:) is the name to discuss.\\nAfter tumbling yesterday following a product launch session in New York, shares of Microsoft bounced back today. What’s happening here is that the company is making a push into the hardware arena. Specifically, it’s renewing its smartphone push with a foldable version of the Surface, known as the Surface Duo.\\nThose familiar with Microsoft know the company has a spotty history in the mobile phone arena, one littered with more failures than successes. The Duo, which is expected to be available in time for the 2020 holiday shopping season, won’t run on Windows. Rather, it will run on Google’s (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\\xa0Android operating system.\\nIndustry observers are already saying marketing for Duo will be essential and it remains to be seen if Microsoft markets the product as a true smartphone or a tablet from which users can make and take calls.\\nOverall, Thursday was a decent day and the first one of that nature since the fourth quarter starter. However, risks linger, namely due to these troubling economic data points. As one potential harbinger of ongoing weakness, oil prices have fallen for eight consecutive days. That would not be happening if market participants were enthusiastic about the global economy.\\nBarclays was out with a note today saying there’s a 25% to 30% chance of recession over the next 12 months. Those aren’t short odds, but they probably can’t be ignored either.\\nTodd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\nEmail Address*\\nCountry*Please select…United StatesAfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d\\'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People\\'s Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People\\'s Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyan Arab JamahiriyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarReunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands (British)Virgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\\nYes!

Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) investors have been anxious about those forthcoming services all year, with the stock having recently given\\xa0up all of its year-to-date gains ahead of the looming competition.\\nCEO Reed Hastings acknowledged\\xa0last month that it would be \"a whole new world starting in November.\" Hastings added, \"It\\'ll be tough competition.\" However, at least one Wall Street analyst isn\\'t too concerned.\\nImage source: Netflix.\\nPiper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson put out a research note\\xa0this week expressing confidence in Netflix\\'s ability to weather the competitive storm, based in part on a survey of Netflix subscribers that suggests the company should be able to retain the majority of its U.S. subscribers. The video-streaming leader had rattled investors over the summer when it reported its first U.S. subscriber loss in nearly a decade.\\n\"Our survey suggests that the majority (~75%) of Netflix subscribers do not intend to subscribe to either Disney+ or Apple TV+,\" Olson wrote in a note to investors. \"For those that do expect to use one of these offerings, the vast majority expect to also maintain their Netflix subscription.\"\\nImage source: Disney.\\nThere were approximately 1,500 respondents included in the survey, with most existing subscribers expressing little interest in the rival services: 77% of respondents weren\\'t interested in Apple TV+ and 72% felt the same way about Disney+. Video-streaming services aren\\'t entirely mutually exclusive, and many subscribers will sign up for numerous services.\\nIf anything, consumers are more likely to cut their cable budgets to make room for more over-the-top (OTT) services. \"Most existing Netflix subscribers appear to be trending toward multiple streaming video subscriptions, especially as many continue to reduce their spend on traditional TV offerings,\" the analyst said.\\nBesides, most Apple TV+ viewers probably won\\'t have to pay anything for a while, as the Cupertino tech giant is giving away a free year of service bundled with hardware purchases. With the holiday shopping season on the horizon, Apple will be giving away tens of millions of subscriptions over the next few months. At just $7 per month for Disney+, the House of Mouse is also taking an aggressive pricing strategy in order to make the service\\'s value proposition hard to resist.\\nOlson also noted that Netflix shares have hit \"multi-year valuation lows,\" suggesting that investors are already pricing in the competitive risks that the company is about to face. Piper Jaffray reiterated an overweight rating and $440 price target.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Learning from its mistake of trying to compete in mobile operating systems against juggernauts Apple and Alphabet, the company created a new phone that runs on Alphabet\\'s Android operating system.\\n\"Surface Duo brings together the best of Microsoft productivity experiences, Android apps and Surface hardware design into a single device you can take anywhere,\" the company said.\\xa0\"And, yes, it makes phone calls.\"\\nThe Surface Duo features two thin 5.6-inch screens.\\nPerhaps by giving its users access to the Android app store, Microsoft will have a shot at capturing meaningful market share in the smartphone business this time around. But investors shouldn\\'t count on it. The smartphone business is extremely competitive. Apple recently released its own new smartphones, and Alphabet will likely announce new Pixel-branded smartphones during its Oct. 15 Made by Google event.\\xa0\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
